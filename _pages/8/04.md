# Target

Our target in this lesson will be Flare 1.12.

# Identify

Our goal in this lesson is to change the Rotting Zombie enemy in Flare. This
will consist of giving it a new name, new statistics, and new artwork.

# Understand

Entities in games typically have several resources associated with them:

- Images
- Models (for 3D games)
- Animations
- Sounds
- Functional Data (such as the name, the movement rate, etc.)

The game's code implements the logic to load and manage all these
resources. For example, take the following scene from Flare where a Zombie
is walking toward our player:

![Flare](/assets/images/8/4/flare1.png)

In this scene, the game has already loaded the base image for the enemy
when our player entered the screen, along with loading its name and base
health into the game's memory. When the game's AI code executes and
determines that the enemy should walk toward our player, an animation is
applied that cycles through several still images to give the illusion of a
moving image. Any walking sounds are then played by the game through the
audio logic set up.

By identifying and modifying all these resources, we can completely change
the enemy.

# Disclaimer

The process to modify game resources is going to be unique for each game.
Flare stores its resources unpacked and in an editable format. Other games
will require different methods to locate and modify the resources.
However, the overall goal will still be the same.

# Locating and Changing Data

First, we will locate where Flare stores the resources. If we look at
Flare's install directory (*C:\Program Files (x86)\Flare*), we can
see that outside the executables and DLL's, the largest folder appears to
be the *mods* folder, indicating that this may be where the game
stores resources:

![Flare](/assets/images/8/4/flare2.png)

Inside this folder are several folders and a single file, *mods.txt*:

![Flare](/assets/images/8/4/flare3.png)

If we open *mods.txt,* we see that it contains the following
information:

```c++
# Mods lower on the list will overwrite data in the entries higher on the list

fantasycore
empyrean_campaign
```

These names match the folders we also see in the directory, indicating
that these folders contained the resources loaded by the game. First, we
will look at the *fantasycore* folder:

![Flare](/assets/images/8/4/flare4.png)

This contains several of the folders we know are associated with game
resources. If we look inside */enemies/base/*, we see a
*zombie.txt* file that contains the following data:

![Flare](/assets/images/8/4/flare5.png)

While we see important information here, such as the animation file for
the zombie enemy, we do not see information we would expect, such as
health, attack damage, or the name of the enemy. Instead, this file looks
like it contains common data that other files build off of. If we look in
the *empyrean_campaign/enemies/* folder, we see that this guess is
correct. In this folder, we see the file
*lvl1_zombie_rotting.txt* which contains the rest of the data we
would expect:

![Flare](/assets/images/8/4/flare6.png)

For this lesson, we will change a few sections of data, including the enemy's
name, HP, and speed. This will produce a weak enemy that runs quickly
across the screen:

![Flare](/assets/images/8/4/flare7.png)

# Changing Graphics

Next, we will edit the graphics for the enemy. We identified the location
of the *animations* file in the previous section. If we open this
file, we see that it looks like:

![Flare](/assets/images/8/4/flare8.png)

This initially looks overwhelming, but will make more sense when we
examine the *zombie.png* image that is specified in the file. This is
just a.png file and can be opened up with a program like Paint.NET. This
can be installed via:

```powershell
cinst paint.net
```

![Flare](/assets/images/8/4/flare9.png)

In this image, we can see a variety of poses that the zombie enemy can be
displayed in. The game's logic is responsible for reading the animation
file and displaying a subset of the image. For example, when turning from
left to right, the game will display the highlighted images in quick
succession:

![Flare](/assets/images/8/4/flare10.png)

For a proper mod, we would want to replace all these images with new
graphics. For this lesson, we will simply give everything a blue background:

![Flare](/assets/images/8/4/flare11.png)

After saving this file, start Flare and navigate to a screen with a
*Rotting Zombie* to verify our changes work:
