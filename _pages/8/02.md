# Target

Our target in this lesson will be Flare 1.12.

# Identify

Our goal in this lesson is to identify where a game stores its save data
using two different approaches. Then, we will modify the game's save data
to add extra levels to our character.

# Understand

In the previous lesson, we discussed how games must store save data on the
file system so that the save data can persist between computer restarts.
To access the file system, games must use OS-level API's, such as [CreateFile.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) By hooking these API's, we can determine the save location of a particular game. We can hook these API's in two ways:

- By using a profiling suite, such as Process Monitor
- By attaching a debugger to the game and setting a breakpoint on the API import

Once we have determine the location of the save file, we can then edit it.

# Process Monitor

Process Monitor is a profiling tool owned by Microsoft. It can be used to
monitor file system, registry, and network access from all processes on
the system. The current version can be downloaded [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon)

After extracting the file, start Flare and begin a new game. Then, open up
ProcMon.exe. You should see hundreds of events start to populate the log
view:

By default, Process Monitor monitors all events from all currently running
executables. For our purposes, we only want to see the activity from
Flare. To do this, we can apply a filter by going to *Filter* ->
*Filter*:

![Process Monitor](/assets/images/8/2/procmon2.png)

For this lesson, we want to filter on the *Process Name* of
*flare.exe*. Add this condition and then click the *Add* button.
This filter should then be applied, like so:

![Process Monitor](/assets/images/8/2/procmon3.png)

Process Monitor will now only be displaying events tied to Flare. Next, we
need to trigger an event that will write to our save file. We can do this
by hitting the Escape key and choosing *Save & Exit* in Flare:

![Process Monitor](/assets/images/8/2/procmon4.png)

Doing so will cause several CreateFile and WriteFile events to be fired.
The items containing the *saves* directory should immediately catch
your attention:

![Process Monitor](/assets/images/8/2/procmon5.png)

We can see that we are writing to two files (*avatar.txt* and
*stash_HC.txt*) in the
*C:\Users\IEUsers\AppData\Roaming\flare\userdata\saves\empyrean\1\\*
directory. If we navigate to that directory, we can see that those are the
only two files:

![Process Monitor](/assets/images/8/2/procmon6.png)

If we open *avatar.txt*, we can see there are several
character-related pieces of data, including our character's current XP and
current build stats:

![Process Monitor](/assets/images/8/2/procmon7.png)

If we modify the *build* entries, save the file, and then load it in
Flare, we see that our changes were successful:

![Process Monitor](/assets/images/8/2/procmon8.png)

# Debugger Breakpoint

We can also identify the location of a save file through the use of a
debugger. Like we have done in previous lessons, attach x64dbg to Flare.

Looking at the API for [WriteFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile), we see that it requires a file handle. This file handle is obtained via
a call to **CreateFile**. Therefore, by setting a breakpoint
on the **CreateFile** function inside kernel32.dll, we will
be able to observe the path of all files the game wishes to write to.

In x64dbg, navigate to the *Symbols* tab. While the API documentation
states that **CreateFile** resides in kernel32.dll, most
traditional kernel32.dll functions now reside in kernelbase.dll. Select
the *kernelbase.dll* module and search for *CreateFile*:

![Process Monitor](/assets/images/8/2/x64dbg1.png)

Double-click the *CreateFileA* entry and set a breakpoint on the
first instruction (**mov edi, edx**). Next, go into Flare and
save your game. The breakpoint should immediately pop. In the stack view
at the bottom right, you can observe the save file path being pushed on
the top of the stack:
