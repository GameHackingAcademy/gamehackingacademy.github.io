# Target

Our target for this lesson will be Urban Terror 4.3.4.

# Identify

Our goal in this lesson is to determine how Urban Terror stores its resources
and how to unpack them. Then, we will modify a texture in the game and
recompile the textures.

# Understand

From a previous lesson, we know that resources must be stored on the file
system. Due to their size, these resources are most likely packed into
some sort of archive. Because the game must know how to unpack these
resources, it must be possible for us to also unpack them. If we can
identify where these resources are stored and how they are packed, we can
unpack them, modify them, and repack them.

# Locating Resources

After downloading the game through the updater, the *q3ut4* directory
is created and populated with data. If we navigate into this directory, we
can see a variety of files. By choosing *View* -> *Group By* ->
*Type*, we can see all the files grouped by their file type:

![Urban Terror](/assets/images/8/3/urbanterror1.png)

The size of the highlighted pk3 files indicate that these may store the
game's resources. To quickly examine the contents of these files, we can
use the following Powershell command:

```powershell
type .\zUrT43_001.pk3 | select -first 10
```

The **type** command prints out the content of a file.
However, we only want to see the beginning of the file to see if there is
anything in there that may indicate how the file is packed. The
**select** command accomplishes this by only displaying the
first 10 lines it receives. The **|** operator passes the
results of the **type** command to the
**select** command:

![Urban Terror](/assets/images/8/3/urbanterror2.png)

The highlighted *PK* text and the strings of text (*botfiles*)
indicates that this is a ZIP file. While we could use Windows default ZIP
viewer to view this file, for this lesson, we will use 7zip. This can be
installed via:

```powershell
cinst 7zip
```

With 7zip installed, we can easily explore this pk3 file by right-clicking
and choosing *7zip* -> *Open archive*. Upon doing so, we see
several folders. The names of these folders are related to resources
required by the game:

![Urban Terror](/assets/images/8/3/urbanterror3.png)

If we explore the *botfiles* directory, we see that this game
contains code that controls how each bot operates in its resources:

![Urban Terror](/assets/images/8/3/urbanterror4.png)

If we explore the *env* directory, we see several directories for
different map names. If we look inside the directory for the map
*austria*, we see several static images:

![Urban Terror](/assets/images/8/3/urbanterror5.png)

If you go in-game and load the *austria* map, we can see that these
images make up the skybox of the map:

![Urban Terror](/assets/images/8/3/urbanterror6.png)

If we modify these images, we should be able to modify the skybox of the
level.

# Modifying Resources

Now that we have located the resources, let's extract them and modify
them. Right-click on the *zUrT43_001.pk3* file and choose
*7zip* -> *Extract to*. In the extracted file, navigate to the
*env/austria* folder. For this lesson, we will replace the top of the
skybox with the bottom of the skybox. To do this, first delete the
*austriasky_up.jpg* file, then create a copy of the
*austriasky_dw.jpg* file and rename it to *austriasky_up.jpg*:

![Urban Terror](/assets/images/8/3/urbanterror7.png)

With this change made, navigate to the root of the extracted pk3
directory, select all folders (botfiles, env, fonts, etc.) and choose
*7zip* -> *Add to archive*. Keep the default options and change
the name of the new archive to zUrT43_001.pk3. After 7zip finishes,
replace the zUrT43_001.pk3 file in the *q3ut4* directory with this
new archive. If you start Urban Terror and start a match on the
*austria* map, you should instantly observe that our change was
successful:

![Urban Terror](/assets/images/8/3/urbanterror8.png)

If you explore the other pk3 files, you should observe that all maps,
player models, weapons, and sounds are contained within these files. You
can use the same technique discussed above to modify any of the resources
in the game.
