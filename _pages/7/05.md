# Target

Our target for this lesson will be Assault Cube 1.2.0.2.

# Overview

In previous lessons, we used x64dbg to debug and reverse games. After
attaching x64dbg to these games, we were able to set breakpoints on game
instructions. When the game executed these instructions, our breakpoints
would pop and program execution would pause. We could then observe the
values of all the registers and step through individual instructions.


In this lesson, we will explore how to create a debugger for Windows
utilizing the Windows API. We will confirm that this debugger is working
by using Assault Cube as an example. In the [No Recoil](/pages/5/07/) lesson, we identified that the
**mov** instruction at `0x0046366C` was only
executed when the player was firing. After we create our debugger, we will
place a breakpoint on this instruction and verify that it is only hit when
we fire.

# Windows Debugger API's

Windows has a collection of API’s that allow for a process to attach to
and debug another process. These are detailed in several short articles
available on [MSDN.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/creating-a-basic-debugger)

For our purposes, we mainly care about the following API’s:

- **DebugActiveProcess**, which is used to attach to a target
process
- **WaitForDebugEvent**, which is used to wait for debugging
events, as described in [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/writing-the-debugger-s-main-loop) MSDN article
- **ContinueDebugEvent**, which is used to continue execution
after a debug event is triggered

When using these API’s, we are attaching to a process and waiting for it
to trigger one of several [debug events](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/debugging-events), such as creating a thread or encountering an exception. However, when
debugging a target we do not have the source code to, this will limit us
to only breaking on thread and process creation events.

To be able to trigger a breakpoint on an address, we will need to use an
**interrupt** instruction. Interrupt instructions are a
special set of software instructions that invoke a special interrupt
handler on the CPU. One of these instructions, **int 3**,
will trigger a breakpoint when executed. Its opcode is `0xCC`.

We can utilize this behavior to set a breakpoint on any instruction.
Before we attach a debugger to a process, we will use
**WriteProcessMemory** to write `0xCC` to the
instruction we wish to break on. We will then listen for debug events like
normal. When we get a breakpoint event, we will restore the instruction to
its original form and continue execution. By doing this, we can set
breakpoints on any instruction in targets that we do not have the source
control to.

The full source code for the debugger discussed in this lesson is available
on [github.](https://github.com/GameHackingAcademy/Debugger) 

# Writing the Int 3 Instruction

To write our **int 3** instruction into the target, we will
use an approach covered in previous lessons. First, we will iterate over all
processes in the system using
**CreateToolhelp32Snapshot** and locate the Assault Cube
process (**ac_client.exe**). Then, we will open a handle to
the process, and use that handle to write `0xCC` (the opcode
for **int 3**) over the instruction at
`0x0046366C`:

```c++
HANDLE process_snapshot = NULL;
HANDLE process_handle = NULL;

DWORD pid;
DWORD bytes_written = 0;

BYTE instruction_break = 0xcc;

PROCESSENTRY32 pe32 = { 0 };

pe32.dwSize = sizeof(PROCESSENTRY32);

process_snapshot = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0);
Process32First(process_snapshot, &pe32);

do {
  if (wcscmp(pe32.szExeFile, L"ac_client.exe") == 0) {
    pid = pe32.th32ProcessID;

    process_handle = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, true, pe32.th32ProcessID);
    WriteProcessMemory(process_handle, (void*)0x0046366C, &instruction_break, 1, &bytes_written);
  }
} while (Process32Next(process_snapshot, &pe32));
```

Since we will need the process identifier (or pid) of Assault Cube for the
**DebugActiveProcess** API, we also store the
**pid** for later use.

# Main Debugger Loop

Next, we can use an identical model discussed on [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/creating-a-basic-debugger) to attach to the target and handle debugger events. The code provided on
MSDN enters a permanent loop that checks for debugging events and then
continues execution when encountering an event.

```c++
DEBUG_EVENT debugEvent = { 0 };

DWORD continueStatus = DBG_CONTINUE;

DebugActiveProcess(pid);

for (;;) {
  continueStatus = DBG_CONTINUE;

  if (!WaitForDebugEvent(&debugEvent, INFINITE))
    return 0;

  switch (debugEvent.dwDebugEventCode) {
    case EXCEPTION_DEBUG_EVENT:
      switch (debugEvent.u.Exception.ExceptionRecord.ExceptionCode)
      {
        case EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT:
          continueStatus = DBG_CONTINUE;
          break;
        default:
          continueStatus = DBG_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED;
          break;
      }
      break;
    default:
      continueStatus = DBG_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED;
      break;
  }

  ContinueDebugEvent(debugEvent.dwProcessId, debugEvent.dwThreadId, continueStatus);
}

CloseHandle(process_handle);
```

# Handling the Breakpoint

With this structure setup, we can now begin handling debugger events.
First, let's verify that our **int 3** breakpoint actually
worked with a print statement:

```c++
case EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT:
  printf("Breakpoint hit");

  continueStatus = DBG_CONTINUE;
  break;
```

Make sure Assault Cube is running and run the debugger we have built so
far. It should immediately print out **Breakpoint hit**. If
you then fire, it will print out **Breakpoint hit** again
before the game crashes. This indicates that our breakpoint was set
successfully.

However, crashing the target is not ideal. To fix this, we will need to
adjust two things:

1. Only trigger our breakpoint when the instruction is executed and not
when we first run our program.
1. Restore the original instruction after our breakpoint is executed.

When we first attach to a process, a breakpoint exception is triggered.
Since we only want to handle our breakpoint on the instruction, we will
ignore this first exception:

```c++
bool first_break_has_occurred = false;
case EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT:       
  if (first_break_has_occurred) {
    //only handle breakpoint events after the first exception
  }

  first_break_has_occurred = true;
```

Next, we can handle the crash that occurs after our breakpoint is
triggered. This crash occurs because we have replaced the original
**mov** opcode (`0x8b`) with our interrupt. After
executing our interrupt and our handling of the debug event, the game
tries to execute the next opcode, which is not valid. To resolve this, we
need to restore the mov instruction after handling our debug event.

The **EIP** (extended instruction pointer) register is used
to track the current instruction executing. Each time an instruction is
executed, it is changed to reflect the next instruction address to
execute. When we execute our **int 3** instruction, it is
increased by 1. To restore the **mov** instruction, we need
to first decrease it.

We can do this by opening the thread responsible for triggering the
breakpoint and retrieving the context (registers) of the thread. We can
then decrease the **EIP** register and set the thread's
context to our new values:

```c++
HANDLE thread_handle = NULL;
CONTEXT context = { 0 };

thread_handle = OpenThread(THREAD_ALL_ACCESS, true, debugEvent.dwThreadId);
if (thread_handle != NULL) {
  context.ContextFlags = CONTEXT_ALL;
  GetThreadContext(thread_handle, &context);

  context.Eip--;

  SetThreadContext(thread_handle, &context);
  CloseHandle(thread_handle);
```

**EIP** will now point to the original
**mov** instruction address again (`0x0046366C`).
However, the instruction at this location will still be
**int 3**. To fix this, we can use
**WriteProcessMemory** to write the original opcode back to
the address:

```c++
WriteProcessMemory(process_handle, (void*)0x0046366C, &instruction_normal, 1, &bytes_written);
```

With this change, Assault Cube will no longer crash when our breakpoint is
triggered. In addition, we can set a breakpoint on the
**context.Eip--** line of code and verify that we can view
the contents of all registers when our breakpoint is triggered:

![Disassembly](/assets/images/7/5/debug1.png)

The same approach used to modify **EIP** can be used to
modify other registers as well.
