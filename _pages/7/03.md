# Target

Our target in this lesson will be Wesnoth 1.14.9.

# Overview

In previous lessons, we used Cheat Engine to search for memory addresses and
change their values. Cheat Engine is a type of program known as a memory
scanner. Memory scanners allow you to search for and edit memory inside a
process.

Our goal in this lesson is to create a memory scanner that will operate on
DWORD values for the game Wesnoth.

# Understand
Memory scanners have three main operations:

1. Search all memory for a certain value.
1. Filter previously identified addresses against a new value.
1. Set a memory address to a certain value.

In the previous lesson, we created a pattern scanner that would search the
main Wesnoth module for a series of bytes. We can use the same technique
to search memory for a value. However, in this case, we will scan all
memory from `0x00000000` to `0x7FFFFFFF`. This range
of addresses represents all the [virtual address space](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/virtual-address-space) that a 32-bit Windows executable has access to. When scanning, we will
save any address that is set to a certain value.

To filter these addresses, we will perform the same scan operation
described above with one major difference: instead of scanning from
`0x00000000` to `0x7FFFFFFF`, we will only scan
saved addresses identified from the previous scan step. Any addresses that
still match a provided value will again be saved. In this way, we can
continue to filter down the list of valid addresses.

Finally, to write to an address, we can use the same
**WriteProcessMemory** technique identified in the [External Memory Hack](/pages/3/02/) lesson.

# Program Structure

Before we write our program, we need to determine how we will handle the
multiple operations and passing data from one operation to another.

Since we have three distinct operations for our memory scanner to perform,
we need to determine how to handle these cases. One approach is to create
a separate program for each operation and then transfer data between the
three programs. However, this approach would require us to duplicate logic
between multiple programs, such as the logic to open a process handle.

For this lesson, we will use command-line arguments to designate which
operation we want to perform. For example, if we want to search for the
value 50, we will call our program like:

```powershell
MemoryScanner.exe search 50
```

Since we need to call our scanner multiple times, we need a way to pass
results from one operation to the next. The easiest way to accomplish this
is to use a file. For example, if we search for a value, the file will be
filled with all addresses that match this value. When we filter, addresses
will be read from this file, and then new addresses are placed in the file
if they still match.

# Process Handle

To read and write memory from Wesnoth, we need a process handle. We will
use the same approach we used in the previous lesson to accomplish this:

```c++
#include <windows.h>
#include <tlhelp32.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  HANDLE process_snapshot = 0;
  PROCESSENTRY32 pe32 = { 0 };

  pe32.dwSize = sizeof(PROCESSENTRY32);

  process_snapshot = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0);
  Process32First(process_snapshot, &pe32);

  do {
    if (wcscmp(pe32.szExeFile, L"wesnoth.exe") == 0) {
      HANDLE process = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, true, pe32.th32ProcessID);

      // handle operations

      CloseHandle(process);
      break;
    }
  } while (Process32Next(process_snapshot, &pe32));

  return 0;
}
```

We will pass this process handle to all of our operations.

# Operations

Next, we can add in our operations. To access command-line arguments
passed to our program, we can use the **argv** argument.
**argv[0]** will always hold our program's name on the
command-line (**MemoryScanner.exe**), with
**argv[1]** representing the first argument.

All arguments are passed in as strings. We want our program to search for
**DWORD** values. To convert from a string to a value that we
can use to search for **DWORD**’s, we will use
**strtol**, or (str)ing (to) (l)ong:

```c++
// handle operations
char* p;
long value = strtol(argv[2], &p, 10);

if(strcmp(argv[1], "search") == 0) {
  search(process, value);
}
else if(strcmp(argv[1], "filter") == 0) {
  filter(process, value);
}
else if (strcmp(argv[1], "write") == 0) {
  write(process, value);
}
```

With the base in place, we can now write each of these functions.

# Search

We will start with our search function:
```c++
void search(const HANDLE process, const int passed_val) {
```

Like we discussed in the previous section, we will store the results of
the search in a text file. Like we did back in the [Creating an External Client](/pages/6/04/) lesson, we will use
**fopen_s** to create a text file we can write to:

```c++
FILE* temp_file = NULL;
fopen_s(&temp_file, "res.txt", "w");
```

As we know, memory does not have a particular structure. For example, the
memory from `0x12345678` to `0x1234567C` could hold
the values `0x44 0x45 0x41 0x45`. If read as a DWORD, this
memory would hold the value 1145389381. However, if each byte is read as a
char, this memory would hold the value DEAD. In memory scanners like Cheat
Engine, you can select the type of data to scan for. In this lesson, we will
scan all memory as if it was a DWORD. This will allow us to search for
values that are numbers, such as gold.

Our search operation will scan all memory from `0x00000000` to
`0x7FFFFFFF` and compare each 4 bytes to the value passed in
the second argument. Previously, we used
**ReadProcessMemory** to read a single 4-byte
**DWORD**. However, **ReadProcessMemory** allows
us to read any size of memory into any type of allocated buffer.

While Wesnoth can use all memory from `0x00000000` to
`0x7FFFFFFF`, it first needs to request access via several
API’s, like **VirtualAlloc**. If Wesnoth has not requested
access to a certain piece of memory, it will not be able to read or write
data to it. We are using Wesnoth's handle to read memory, so we will need
to account for this behavior.

If we try to read all memory from `0x00000000` to
`0x7FFFFFFF` with one **ReadProcessMemory** call,
the call will fail. This is because **ReadProcessMemory**'s
behavior is to immediately fail and place a **NULL** value in
our buffer if we encounter a section of memory we do not have access to.
As a result, we will need to split our read requests up into blocks. That
way, if we attempt to scan a block that Wesnoth has not allocated, only
that block's read will fail.

We can choose any value for our block size, but there is a trade-off
between speed and accuracy. The larger each block is, the faster the scan
process will take, but more areas of memory may not be read successfully
due to part of the block being inaccessible. For this lesson, we will choose
a block size of 2056, or `0x808`:

```c++
#define size 0x00000808
```

We will then allocate a buffer that can hold a block-size worth of data:

```c++
unsigned char* buffer = (unsigned char*)calloc(1, size);
```

Next, we will loop through each block of memory from
`0x00000000` to `0x7FFFFFFF` and read that block
into the buffer:

```c++
DWORD bytes_read = 0;

for (DWORD i = 0x00000000; i < 0x7FFFFFFF; i += size) {
  ReadProcessMemory(process, (void*)i, buffer, size, &bytes_read);
```

Finally, we will cast each 4 bytes of our buffer as a
**DWORD** and determine if its value equals the argument
passed. If so, we will write its location to our results file:

```c++
for (int j = 0; j < size - 4; j += 4) {
  DWORD val = 0;
  memcpy(&val, &buffer[j], 4);
  if (val == passed_val) {
    fprintf(temp_file, "%x\n", i + j);
  }
}
```

If a read fails, our buffer will contain nothing but 0's and this final
step will find nothing. After we finish with our
**ReadProcessMemory** loop, we will close the file and free
the buffer's memory:

```c++
fclose(temp_file);
free(buffer);
```

Our search function is now finished. If you build this code and search for
a gold value inside Wesnoth, you will see that
**res.txt** now contains a several addresses:

```powershell
MemoryScanner.exe search 75
```

# Filtering

The next operation we will focus on is filtering. The filtering operation
will take a list of addresses produced by the search operation and check
to see if those addresses equal a new value. If the address does equal the
value, it will be saved. If it does not, it will be deleted:

```c++
void filter(const HANDLE process, const int passed_val) {
```
We will conduct the filtering operation in two parts:

1. Read each memory address from **res.txt** and if it matches
the new value, save it to **res_fil.txt**.
1. Copy **res_fil.txt** to **res.txt** and delete
**res_fil.txt**.

The end result will be a new **res.txt** file that contains
only the filtered addresses. This model will allow us to filter multiple
times. First, we will open **res.txt** for reading
(**r**) and **res_fil.txt** for writing
(**w**):

```c++
FILE* temp_file = NULL;
FILE* temp_file_filter = NULL;
fopen_s(&temp_file, "res.txt", "r");
fopen_s(&temp_file_filter, "res_fil.txt", "w");
```

We will then read each address from **res.txt** line by line
and read Wesnoth's memory at that address. If the value matches our
argument, we will write the address to **res_fil.txt**:

```c++
DWORD address = 0;
while (fscanf_s(temp_file, "%x\n", &address) != EOF) {
  DWORD val = 0;
  DWORD bytes_read = 0;

  ReadProcessMemory(process, (void*)address, &val, 4, &bytes_read);
  if (val == passed_val) {
    fprintf(temp_file_filter, "%x\n", address);
  }
}
```

With all the filtered addresses in **res_fil.txt**, we will
then close both **res.txt** and **res_fil.txt**.
Then, we will open up these files in the opposite order from above, with
**res.txt** for writing and **res_fil.txt** for
reading:

```c++
fclose(temp_file);
fclose(temp_file_filter);

fopen_s(&temp_file, "res.txt", "w");
fopen_s(&temp_file_filter, "res_fil.txt", "r");
```

Next, we will loop through each address in
**res_fil.txt** and copy it to **res.txt**:

```c++
while (fscanf_s(temp_file_filter, "%x\n", &address) != EOF) {
  fprintf(temp_file, "%x\n", address);
}
```

With **res.txt** now containing our addresses, we will close
each file and delete **res_fil.txt**:

```c++
fclose(temp_file);
fclose(temp_file_filter);

remove("res_fil.txt");
```

We can now search for and filter addresses. If you search for your gold in
Wesnoth, buy a unit, and then filter your gold value, you should be left
with a single value. If you open up Cheat Engine and repeat these steps,
you can verify that the address you identified and the address from Cheat
Engine match. This shows that our scanner is properly finding memory
addresses.

```powershell
MemoryScanner.exe filter 54
```

# Writing

The final main operation of a memory scanner is writing values to
identified memory addresses:

```c++
void write(const HANDLE process, const int passed_val) {
```

This operation is identical to the approach we used in the [External Memory Hack](/pages/3/02/) lesson. For each address in
**res.txt**, we will use
**WriteProcessMemory** to write the provided argument value
to the address:

```c++
FILE* temp_file = NULL;
fopen_s(&temp_file, "res.txt", "r");

DWORD address = 0;
while (fscanf_s(temp_file, "%x\n", &address) != EOF) {
  DWORD bytes_written = 0;

  WriteProcessMemory(process, (void*)address, &passed_val, 4, &bytes_written);
}

fclose(temp_file);
```

With this code, we can now write whatever value we want to the previously
searched for and filtered addresses:

```powershell
MemoryScanner.exe write 555
```

The full code for this lesson is available on [github](https://github.com/GameHackingAcademy/MemoryScanner/) for comparison.
