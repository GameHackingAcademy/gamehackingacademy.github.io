# Target

When writing a DLL injector, it is helpful to have an already working DLL
for a particular target. For this lesson, we will use the memory wallhack we
produced in the [Wallhack (Memory)](/pages/5/02/) lesson. While our
injector will be built for the game Urban Terror, we will be able to
easily modify it for other targets in the future.

# Overview

In previous lessons, we used Windows' AppInit functionality to inject DLL’s
into game executables. While this approach works well for testing, it has
several drawbacks:

- AppInit_DLLs needs to be updated for each new DLL.
- AppInit_DLLs are injected into every started process.
- Secure Boot has to be disabled.
- AppInit_DLLs will only be injected into processes that load user32.dll.
- DLL’s are loaded into the process at a set time, outside of our control.

To get around these drawbacks, we will write an injector, which will
manually load our DLL into the game executable.

# Concepts

To load static and dynamic libraries, Windows executables can use the [LoadLibraryA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya) API function. This function takes a single argument, which is a full path
to the library to load.

```c++
HMODULE LoadLibraryA(
  LPCSTR lpLibFileName
);
```

If we call **LoadLibraryA** in our injector's code, the DLL
will be loaded into our injector's memory. Instead, we want our injector
to force the game to call **LoadLibraryA**. To do this, we
will use the [CreateRemoteThread](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createremotethread) API to create a new thread in the game. This thread will then execute
**LoadLibraryA** inside the game's running process.

However, since the thread is running inside the game's memory,
**LoadLibraryA** will not be able to find the path of our DLL
specified in our injector. To get around this, we have to write our DLL's
path into the game's memory. To ensure that we do not corrupt any other
memory, we will also need to allocate additional memory inside the game
using [VirtualAllocEx.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualallocex) The full breakdown of this interaction looks like:

![Stack Parameters](/assets/images/7/1/injection1.png)

As we know from previous lessons, we will need a process handle to interact
with an external process. For example, in the [External Memory Hack](/pages/3/02/) lesson, we used
**FindWindow** and
**GetWindowThreadProcessId** to retrieve a process
identifier. This approach has many drawbacks and is not recommended beyond
quick testing. Instead, we will use
**CreateToolhelp32Snapshot**.

# Process Identifier

To use **WriteProcessMemory**, we will need a handle to the
Urban Terror process. Instead of using **FindWindow** like we
did previously, we will use [CreateToolhelp32Snapshot.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/tlhelp32/nf-tlhelp32-createtoolhelp32snapshot) This API takes a snapshot of all the currently running processes on the
machine. Each process in this snapshot can then be examined using [Process32First](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/tlhelp32/nf-tlhelp32-process32first) and [Process32Next.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/tlhelp32/nf-tlhelp32-process32next) Microsoft provides a good example of how to do this [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/toolhelp/taking-a-snapshot-and-viewing-processes)

While Microsoft's example iterates all processes and dumps their loaded
modules, we are only interested in finding a single process and retrieving
its process identifier. Therefore, we can simplify their example code:

```c++
#include <windows.h>
#include <tlhelp32.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  HANDLE snapshot = 0;
  PROCESSENTRY32 pe32 = { 0 };

  pe32.dwSize = sizeof(PROCESSENTRY32);
  snapshot = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0);
  Process32First(snapshot, &pe32);

  do {

  } while (Process32Next(snapshot, &pe32));

  return 0;
}
```

Each [process entry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/tlhelp32/ns-tlhelp32-processentry32) contains two fields that we care about: **szExeFile** and
**th32ProcessID**. The former contains the name of the
process, like svchost.exe or notepad.exe. The latter contains the process
identifier of the process that we can pass to
**OpenProcess**.

The process name of Urban Terror is **Quake3-UrT.exe**. This
can be identified by viewing the process list in Task Manager while Urban
Terror is running. To compare this value to the value in
**szExeFile**, we can use the function
**strcmp**. This function takes two strings and returns 0 if
they match:

```c++
do {
  if (wcscmp(pe32.szExeFile, L"Quake3-UrT.exe") == 0) {

  }
}
```

# Process Handle

When these strings match, we know that
**pe32.th32ProcessID** must contain the process identifier
for the running instance of Urban Terror. We can pass this value to
**OpenProcess** just like we did in previous lessons:

```c++
HANDLE process = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, true, pe32.th32ProcessID);
```

# Allocating Memory

Next, we need to allocate memory inside of Urban Terror to store the full
path of our DLL. To do this, we will use **VirtualAllocEx**,
which is defined as:

```c++
LPVOID VirtualAllocEx(
  HANDLE hProcess,
  LPVOID lpAddress,
  SIZE_T dwSize,
  DWORD  flAllocationType,
  DWORD  flProtect
);
```

Going through the arguments, **hProcess** will be the process
handle we obtained from **OpenProcess**.
**lpAddress** will be **NULL**, since we do not
care where the address is allocated. **dwSize** will be the
length of the path to our DLL. Since we want to allocate memory and have
it be usable, we will choose **MEM_COMMIT** as the allocation
type. Finally, since we want to write to the allocated memory, we will
specify the protection as **PAGE_READWRITE**.

**VirtualAllocEx** will return a
**void** pointer containing the address that our memory is
allocated at. Since we will need this value for our next call to
**WriteProcessMemory**, we will have to create a variable for
it. We will also need to create a variable for the full path of our DLL.
Due to how C++ interprets backslashes, we need to use two
**\**'s for each single backslash. With all these parameters
worked out, we can add the following code:

```c++
const char *dll_path = "C:\\Users\\IEUser\\source\\repos\\wallhack\\Debug\\wallhack.dll";
...
void *lpBaseAddress = VirtualAllocEx(process, NULL, strlen(dll_path) + 1, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE);
```

# Writing the DLL Name

With our memory now allocated, we can write our DLL name into Urban
Terror's memory using **WriteProcessMemory**. The base
address for writing will be the address that we retrieved from
**VirtualAllocEx**:

```c++
WriteProcessMemory(process, lpBaseAddress, dll_path, strlen(dll_path) + 1, NULL);
```

# Creating the Thread

With our DLL's path written into the game's memory, we can create a thread
to execute **LoadLibraryA** to load the DLL into the game. We
will use **CreateRemoteThread** to create the thread, but
first, we need to obtain the address of **LoadLibraryA**.

**LoadLibraryA** exists inside kernel32.dll. Windows takes
care of loading this DLL into all processes that need any API contained
inside kernel32.dll. To obtain the address of
**LoadLibraryA**, we can use [GetProcAddress](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress). This API requires a handle to the DLL that contains the function, in
this case kernel32.dll. We can get this handle using [GetModuleHandle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getmodulehandlea):

```c++
HMODULE kernel32base = GetModuleHandle(L"kernel32.dll");
```

Now we can use **CreateRemoteThread** to load our DLL. [CreateRemoteThread's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createremotethread) definition looks like:

```c++
HANDLE CreateRemoteThread(
  HANDLE                 hProcess,
  LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES  lpThreadAttributes,
  SIZE_T                 dwStackSize,
  LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE lpStartAddress,
  LPVOID                 lpParameter,
  DWORD                  dwCreationFlags,
  LPDWORD                lpThreadId
);
```

Let's step through each parameter required. The process will be the
process handle for Urban Terror, identical to
**WriteProcessMemory**. The next two parameters we do not
need, so we can pass **NULL** and **0** for
them. Our start address will be the address of
**LoadLibraryA** that we retrieve through
**GetProcAddress**. Finally, we need to pass a single
parameter to **LoadLibraryA**, our DLL path, which we know
from our call to **VirtualAllocEx**. For the purpose of our
injector, we can ignore the last two parameters as well. With all of this
down, our call ends up looking like:

```c++
HANDLE thread = CreateRemoteThread(process, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)GetProcAddress(kernel32base, "LoadLibraryA"), lpBaseAddress, 0, NULL);
```

We have some additional operations we need to do with our thread, so we
will save a handle to the thread. Before exiting, we want our injector to
wait until the thread has been created and finished executing. We can do
this via [WaitForSingleObject](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-waitforsingleobject) and [GetExitCodeThread:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getexitcodethread)

```c++
WaitForSingleObject(thread, INFINITE);
GetExitCodeThread(thread, &exitCode);
```

# Clean Up

Finally, we can free up the memory we allocated and close the open handles
we have after our DLL has been injected:

```c++
VirtualFreeEx(process, lpBaseAddress, 0, MEM_RELEASE);
CloseHandle(thread);
CloseHandle(process);
break;
```
The final **break** exits the loop that we created to scan
through each process.

With all of this done, we can start Urban Terror, enter a game, and then
run our injector. If everything went successfully, players will start
appearing through walls, indicating that our DLL was injected. If it
fails, make sure to run the injector with administrator permissions.
