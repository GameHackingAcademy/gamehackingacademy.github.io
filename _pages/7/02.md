# Target

Our targets in this lesson will be Wesnoth 1.14.9 and Wesnoth 1.14.12.

# Overview

In the [Changing Game Code](/pages/2/03/) lesson, we located the
**sub** instruction responsible for subtracting gold from our
player when we recruited a unit. In the 1.14.9 version of the game, we
located this instruction at `0x7CCD9E`:

If a game's code is not loaded dynamically, addresses for instructions
will not change. As such, we can consistently use them when programming.
We used this behavior across several targets to build code caves, such as
in the [Code Caves & DLL's](/pages/3/04/) lesson.

However, newer versions of Wesnoth have been released, like 1.14.12. This
version can be installed using Chocolatey in the same way we installed
version 1.14.9:

```powershell
choco install wesnoth --version=1.14.12 -y
```

Most games will continually release additional versions and require
updates to continue playing on multiplayer servers. If we examine
`0x7CCD9E` in Wesnoth 1.14.12, we see that the
**sub** instruction is no longer there:

When developers introduce new features or fix bugs in each release, they
modify the game's code. They then compile these changes to produce a new
executable for the game. Since this new executable has different code, the
location of all code in the game will change. This is why the
**sub** instruction is no longer present at
`0x7CCD9E` in version 1.14.12.

# Opcodes

If we wanted to find the new address of the
**sub** instruction, one approach is to repeat the exact same
method we used in the [Changing Game Code](/pages/2/03/) lesson. If
we do this, we can identify that the sub instruction in 1.14.12 is located
at `0x7D177E`:

![Wesnoth Gold Instruction](/assets/images/7/2/pattern3.png)

However, if we wanted to then upgrade our hack to a newer version, like
1.14.15, we would have to repeat this process again. This is a
time-intensive process, especially for more complex tasks, like locating a
player's base pointer.

Back in the [Computer Fundamentals](/pages/1/01/) lesson, we
covered operation codes, or opcodes. Each opcode represents an instruction
to execute. x64dbg displays the opcode for each instruction in the column
to the left of the instruction:

![Wesnoth Gold Instruction](/assets/images/7/2/pattern4.png)

For example, the opcode for the **sub** instruction we
identified is `0x2942 04`.

Executables do not store their code as assembly instructions. Rather, they
store it as opcodes. The disassembly observed in x64dbg is reconstructed
from these opcodes. We can verify this by opening up wesnoth.exe in a hex
editor, a type of program that displays the hexadecimal bytes of a chosen
file. In this lesson, we will use HxD:

```powershell
choco install hxd
```

After opening wesnoth.exe, we can search for the opcode identified above
via *Search* -> *Find*:

![Wesnoth Gold Instruction](/assets/images/7/2/pattern5.png)

In the dialog that appears, we want to search for the hex value of our
opcode:

![Wesnoth Gold Instruction](/assets/images/7/2/pattern6.png)

Searching should highlight the opcode value:

![Wesnoth Gold Instruction](/assets/images/7/2/pattern7.png)

Looking at the values near the highlighted value, we can see that they
represent the other opcodes near the sub instruction.

# Scanning

If we compare the opcodes for the **sub** instruction between
1.14.9 and 1.14.12, we can see that they are identical. This is because
the opcodes for a particular instruction will always be the same. Since
these opcodes do not change, we can scan for these bytes to locate the
instruction we care about. This is known as pattern scanning.

Due to how Windows loads PE files into virtual memory, the address for the
instruction differs between the hex editor and x64dbg. Since we want to
locate and alter the running code, we are interested in identifying the
latter address.

To accomplish this, we need to read the memory from a running instance of
Wesnoth and then search that memory for a series of bytes. In this lesson, we
will write an external program to demonstrate the concept, but this same
behavior can be used inside a DLL to automatically update offsets.

Since we want to locate a running process and retrieve a process handle,
we can start with the base that we already discussed in the [DLL Injector](/pages/7/01/) lesson:

```c++
#include <windows.h>
#include <tlhelp32.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  HANDLE snapshot = 0;
  PROCESSENTRY32 pe32 = { 0 };

  pe32.dwSize = sizeof(PROCESSENTRY32);
  snapshot = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0);
  Process32First(snapshot, &pe32);

  do {
    if (wcscmp(pe32.szExeFile, L"wesnoth.exe") == 0) {
      HANDLE process = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, true, pe32.th32ProcessID);

      CloseHandle(process);
      break;
    }
  } while (Process32Next(snapshot, &pe32));

  return 0;
}
```

With the process handle to Wesnoth, our next goal is to read the process's
memory into a buffer that we can scan. However, processes are made up of
many modules, or sections of code. For example, the Wesnoth process has
modules for the main game code (wesnoth.exe), compression code
(zlib1.dll), and graphics code (sdl.dll). We can observe all the modules
loaded into the process using x64dbg's *Symbol* tab:

![Wesnoth Modules](/assets/images/7/2/pattern8.png)

Since our **sub** instruction is in the wesnoth.exe module,
we only want to scan this memory. To do this, we want to identify the base
address of the module and its size. The
**CreateToolhelp32Snapshot** API also allows us to iterate
over a process's modules using **Module32First** and
**Module32Next**:

```c++
if (wcscmp(pe32.szExeFile, L"wesnoth.exe") == 0) {
  HANDLE process = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, true, pe32.th32ProcessID);

  HANDLE module_snapshot = 0;
  MODULEENTRY32 me32;

  me32.dwSize = sizeof(MODULEENTRY32);
  module_snapshot = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPMODULE, pe32.th32ProcessID);
  Module32First(module_snapshot, &me32);
  do {
    if (wcscmp(me32.szModule, L"wesnoth.exe") == 0) {

      break;
    }
  } while (Module32Next(module_snapshot, &me32));

  CloseHandle(process);
  break;
}
```

At this point, the **me32** structure will hold a few members
that we care about: **modBaseAddr**, the base address of the
module, and **modBaseSize**, the size of the module. We will
use these two members to allocate a buffer and read the module's memory
into the buffer:

```c++
unsigned char *buffer = (unsigned char*)calloc(1, me32.modBaseSize);
DWORD bytes_read = 0;

ReadProcessMemory(process, (void*)me32.modBaseAddr, buffer, me32.modBaseSize, &bytes_read);

//scanning code

free(buffer);
```

At this point, our buffer contains the content of the memory from the
wesnoth.exe module base to the end of the module. This memory contains the
opcodes for the game's code. We can now scan over this memory to look for
our pattern of bytes.

For each byte in the buffer, we will see if the pattern exists starting at
the byte. If not, we will continue on to the next byte. If all the bytes
match, we will print the offset in the buffer combined with the
wesnoth.exe module base:

```c++
unsigned char bytes[] = { 0x29, 0x42, 0x04 };

for (unsigned int i = 0; i < me32.modBaseSize - sizeof(bytes); i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < sizeof(bytes); j++) {
    if (bytes[j] != buffer[i + j]) {
      break;
    }

    if (j + 1 == sizeof(bytes)) {
      printf("%x\n", i + (DWORD)me32.modBaseAddr);
    }
  }
}
```

If we start Wesnoth 1.14.12 and then run our scanner, it will correctly
print out the location of the **sub** instruction:

![Wesnoth Gold Instruction](/assets/images/7/2/pattern9.png)

We can use this on any version of Wesnoth to locate the
**sub** instruction we care about.
