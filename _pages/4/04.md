*Note: The pointers provided in this lesson will likely be incorrect. The code will likely have to be updated to use the pointers and offsets you identify.*

# Target

Our target in this lesson will be [Flare 1.12,](https://flarerpg.org/) an ARPG that shares many
characteristics with games like Diablo. Like our other targets so far,
this game is free, open source, and not protected by any anti-cheat.

# Identify

To acquire gold and experience in Flare and other APRGs, players need to
repeatedly kill enemies. Our goal in this lesson is to write a bot that will
automatically locate enemies on the screen and send our player to attack
them. While we will only kill enemies in this lesson, this same approach can
be expanded on to gather any dropped items.

# Understand

To write a farming bot, we first need to locate three items in memory:

1. Our player's position
1. An enemy's position
1. Our mouse or cursor position

Once we have located these items, we can determine the direction from our
player to the enemy. In games like Flare and Diablo, you move by clicking
on a spot. Therefore, we can set our cursor position to the direction
facing the enemy and send a click event. We will place this logic in some
sort of loop to continually adjust direction as the enemy and player move.

# Locating Player Position

We will begin by finding our player's X and Y position. First, start Flare
and create a new character. The first area in the game has no enemies and
is perfect for finding our position. While we do not know the exact value
of the player's position, we can assume that the position is most likely
stored as a float value. As such, we will scan for an
*Unknown value* type with the *Value Type* set to *Float*.

After the first scan, move your character down on the map and change the
scan type to *Increased value* and filter the results. Then, move
your character up on the map and change the scan type to
*Decreased value*. Repeat this process until you have approximately
150 results left.

At this point, all of our results will contain the same value and we will
be unable to filter our result set further. However, we know that only one
of these addresses must store the true value of the player's position. We
will have to identify this address manually. To quickly do this, bring all
the results down to the bottom pane. Then, select roughly half of the
addresses and set their value to another value:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare1.png)

If your character in game suddenly teleports to a different position, you
know that the true address is somewhere in the selected addresses. If not,
you know that none of these addresses hold the player's position and can
be deleted. Using this process, you can quickly trim down the list of
addresses and find the one responsible for the player's position. In this
lab, the address identified was `0x0AE6931C`. Due to [DMA](/pages/2/07/), your address will most likely be different.

With the address identified, we can use Cheat Engine's
*Find out what writes to this address* option, which will attach a
debugger to the process to determine what code is altering the memory:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare2.png)

With this set, go back into Flare and move your character around the
screen. You should see that a single location is writing to the address.
Like in the [Macro Bot](/pages/4/03/) lesson, your address will
most likely be different due to code being dynamically loaded in this
game.

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare3.png)

Close Cheat Engine and start x64dbg. After attaching it to Flare, view the
code at the location you identified in Cheat Engine.

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare4.png)

When assembled, floating point numbers are treated uniquely and have
several instructions associated with them. For this lesson, we will only need
to understand the **fstp** instruction. This instruction
operates like a **mov** instruction and copies the value in
**st0** to the other address specified (like
**dword ptr ds:[ebx]**). **st0** is a special
float-point register. We will examine floating point operations more in
the [No Recoil](/pages/5/07/) lesson.

From the highlighted code above, we can see that floating point values are
placed in **ebp** and **ebx**. If we set a
breakpoint on the
**fstp dword ptr ss:[ebp],st(0)** instruction and then move
our character, our breakpoint will pop. After popping, right-click on
**ebx** and choose *Follow in dump*. You will see values
similar to the following in the *Dump* section:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare5.png)

These values represent the **DWORD** representation of the
float values. We can view the floating point value by right-clicking on
the value and choosing *Float* -> *Float (32-bit)*:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare6.png)

Doing so will reveal the values we have seen before in Cheat Engine:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare7.png)

From this, we can assume that at this point in execution,
**ebp** and **ebx** hold the X and Y position of
the player.

# Flare Coordinates

If you move directly up and down in Flare, you will notice that both the X
and Y position values change. Likewise, if you move left and right, both
of the values change as well. We would expect only one of the values to
change in both of these cases. As such, we need to briefly examine the
coordinate system in the game.

Flare, like many ARPGs, is rendered in an isometric perspective. For our
purposes, this effectively means that the X and Y axes are rotated 45
degrees, like so:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare8.png)

If you move your character along these axes, you will notice only one
value changes.

# Locating Enemy Position

The code we identified in the previous section appeared lower-level, due
to the amount of floating point operations and the lack of branching or
**call** instructions. If we consider the function chain in
Flare, it may look like:

```c++
game_loop()
  handle_input()
    update_character()
      update_position()
```

Our identified code is most likely located in the
**update_position()** method. Often games will reuse
lower-level code like **update_position()** for multiple
entities. For example, the function chain for updating enemies make look
like:

```c++
game_loop()
  handle_input()
    update_enemies()
      update_position()
```

If Flare is using this model, we can use the code we located when
searching for our player to also locate our enemies. This will not be the
case with every game, but it is worth trying to make reversing easier.

First, set a breakpoint again on the **fstp** instruction we
identified previously. In Flare, move your character around the screen to
make the breakpoint pop. When it does, execute until return and step over
to go up a single level of code:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare9.png)

If we look above the call, we see the following code:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare10.png)

Examining the highlighted code, we see that **eax** and
**ebx** are set to values within 4 bytes of each other. This
matches the distance we observed between the X and Y positions. If we set
a breakpoint on the **add ebx, 240** instruction and view
**ebx** in the dump, we can confirm that
**eax** and **ebx** contain our player's X and Y
position.

Next, disable the breakpoint and go back into Flare. In game, move to the
next screen, which has several enemies. Once there, stop moving your
player and re-enable the breakpoint on the
**add ebx, 240** instruction. After a bit, the breakpoint
should pop again. If you examine **eax** and
**ebx** in the dump, you should see that they are at a
different address from our player's X and Y position, but contain similar
values:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare11.png)

The fact that this code is called for both players and enemies indicates
that the game shares this code and calls it from different locations. We
can observe this behavior by first disabling the breakpoint and moving our
character back to the first screen with no enemies. Then, re-enable the
breakpoint and move your character to cause it to pop. Once it does, use
execute until return and step over to navigate up a level to the calling
code for the player:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare12.png)

Then, disable the breakpoint and move your character back to the screen
with the enemies. Do the same process as above to make the breakpoint pop
again and then navigate up a level. You will notice that this location is
different from the player's position:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare13.png)

We will use these differences when programming our hack to determine enemy
positions.

# Locating Mouse Position

With our player and enemy positions now located, we need to locate our
mouse position in memory. This will allow us to set the mouse position
toward the enemy when we write our hack.

Windows has several API's to manipulate the mouse position inside a
window, like [SetCursorPos.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setcursorpos)
This API takes two **int**s as X and Y parameters. As a
result, we know we can scan for a *Value Type* set to *4 Bytes*.

Start with a scan for an *Unknown value* type. Then, move your cursor
to the right and search for *Increased value*. When you get to the
edge of the window, move your cursor to the left and search for
*Decreased value*. Eventually, you should narrow down your results to
a few addresses:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare14.png)

You can determine the exact address by changing each entry and observing
when the cursor moves. Then, like we have done in previous lessons, set a
breakpoint on write on this address and move your mouse in Flare. The
breakpoint should pop immediately at the following location:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare15.png)

If you look at **ebp+0x644** in the dump, we can see that the
X and Y coordinates of the mouse are stored right next to each other.

# Hooking and Dynamic Code

With these locations identified, we can begin to program our hack. For
this hack, we will use 3 code caves:

1. A code cave to retrieve the mouse's X and Y coordinates.
1. A code cave to retrieve the player's X and Y coordinates.
1. A code cave in the **update_position** method to retrieve enemy X and Y coordinates.

We will then create a thread that will check to see if the current entity
in the **update_position** method is a player or an enemy. If
it is an enemy, the thread will set our mouse X and Y coordinates to the
direction of the enemy.

Like we initially saw in the [Macro Bot](/pages/4/03/) lesson,
Flare also loads its code dynamically. As a result, we will need to offset
the addresses we identified above from the base address of the module. For
the addresses in this lesson, the base address of the Flare.exe module was
`0x00830000`. For our code caves, we will redirect the
following 3 instructions:

1. Mouse - `0x91CBC8` **call 0x884210**
1. Player - `0x83CAC4` **call 0x850840**
1. Loop - `0x89BA94` **call 0x89B180**

All of these instructions are close to instructions we identified when
reversing in the previous section of this lesson.

First, we will begin the DLL structure we have seen in previous lessons:

```c++
#include <Windows.h>

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved) {
  DWORD old_protect;

  if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {
    //hooking code 
  }

  return true;
}
```

Then, identically to how we have created hooks in previous lessons, we will
hook the 3 instructions identified above:

```c++
HANDLE flare_base;

DWORD mouse_call_address;
DWORD mouse_return_address;

DWORD player_call_address;
DWORD player_return_address;

DWORD loop_call_address;
DWORD loop_return_address;

...
if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {
  //hooking code      
  flare_base = GetModuleHandle(L"flare.exe");

  // mouse hook
  mouse_call_address = (DWORD)flare_base + 0x54210;

  unsigned char* hook_location = (unsigned char*)((DWORD)flare_base + 0xECBC8);
  mouse_return_address = (DWORD)hook_location + 5;

  VirtualProtect((void*)hook_location, 5, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &old_protect);
  *hook_location = 0xE9;
  *(DWORD*)(hook_location + 1) = (DWORD)&mouse_codecave - ((DWORD)hook_location + 5);

  // player hook
  player_call_address = (DWORD)flare_base + 0x20840;

  hook_location = (unsigned char*)((DWORD)flare_base + 0xCAC4);
  player_return_address = (DWORD)hook_location + 5;

  VirtualProtect((void*)hook_location, 5, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &old_protect);
  *hook_location = 0xE9;
  *(DWORD*)(hook_location + 1) = (DWORD)&player_codecave - ((DWORD)hook_location + 5);

  // game loop hook
  loop_call_address = (DWORD)flare_base + 0x6B180;

  hook_location = (unsigned char*)((DWORD)flare_base + 0x6BA94);
  loop_return_address = (DWORD)hook_location + 5;

  VirtualProtect((void*)hook_location, 5, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &old_protect);
  *hook_location = 0xE9;
  *(DWORD*)(hook_location + 1) = (DWORD)&loop_codecave - ((DWORD)hook_location + 5);
```

To wrap up our **DllMain** function, we also want to create
our thread:

```c++
CreateThread(NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)injected_thread, NULL, 0, NULL);
```

# Mouse Code Cave

When our mouse code cave executes, **ebp+0x664** holds the
cursor's X position and **ebp+0x668** holds the cursor's Y
position. Our code cave will retrieve these values and assign two pointers
to their location, **mouse_x** and **mouse_y**:

```c++
DWORD* mouse_x = NULL;
DWORD* mouse_y = NULL;

__declspec(naked) void mouse_codecave() {
  __asm {
    call mouse_call_address
    pushad
    mov eax, ebp
    add eax, 0x664
    mov ebx, ebp
    add ebx, 0x668
    mov mouse_x, eax
    mov mouse_y, ebx
    popad
    jmp mouse_return_address
  }
}
```

# Player Code Cave

In a similar manner to our mouse code cave, when our player code cave
executes, **ecx+0x240** holds the player's X position and
**ecx+0x244** holds the player's Y position. Our code cave
will retrieve these values and assign two pointers to their location:

```c++
float* player_x = NULL;
float* player_y = NULL;

__declspec(naked) void player_codecave() {
  __asm {
    pushad
    mov eax, ecx 
    add eax, 0x240
    mov player_x, eax 
    add eax, 4
    mov player_y, eax
    popad
    call player_call_address
    jmp player_return_address
  }
}
```

# Loop Code Cave

Our loop code cave will hook the location that is shared between the
player and enemy methods for updating a position. When this code cave
executes, **ebx** will store the Y position of the player or
enemy and **ebx - 4** will store the X position. Like the
previous two code caves, we will assign pointers to these addresses:

```c++
float* enemy_x = NULL;
float* enemy_y = NULL;

__declspec(naked) void loop_codecave() {
  __asm {
    pushad
    mov eax, ebx
    sub eax, 4
    mov enemy_x, eax
    mov enemy_y, ebx
    popad
    call loop_call_address
    jmp loop_return_address
  }
}
```

# Bot Thread

With all of our pointers assigned, we can finally create the main logic of
the bot. This thread will constantly check to see if all the pointers are
assigned. If they are, the thread will then check to make sure that the
character being updated is not the player. As a last check, we make sure
that the "M" key is being held down so that our bot can be toggled:

```c++
void injected_thread() {
  while (true) {
    if (player_x != NULL && player_y != NULL && enemy_x != NULL && enemy_y != NULL 
    && player_x != enemy_x && player_y != enemy_y
    && mouse_x != NULL && mouse_y != NULL && GetAsyncKeyState('M')) {
      // move player
    }

    Sleep(1);
  }
}
```

If all these conditions are met, we know that an enemy is moving on the
same screen as our player and we want to start moving our player toward
the enemy. In this lesson, our bot will try to take a direct path to the
enemy, as this is the easiest logic to implement. For a more complete
farming bot, we would need to make sure to guide our player character
around obstacles.

Movement in Flare, like most ARPGs, is done by clicking in the direction
you want to move. Our bot will move in four directions, based on the axes
we discussed earlier:

![Searching for player position](/assets/images/4/4/flare16.png)

Since we are taking a direct path, we can set the mouse cursor based on
the enemy's position relative to our player. For example, if the enemy is
to the left of us, we will set our mouse cursor to the left of our player.
The mouse position values can be retrieved by hovering the mouse over the
highlighted positions above and viewing the value at the mouse address in
the dump of x64dbg:

```c++
if (*enemy_x < *player_x) {
  *mouse_x = 490;
}
else {
  *mouse_x = 560;
}

if (*enemy_y > *player_y) {
  *mouse_y = 270;
}
else {
  *mouse_y = 330;
}
```

Finally, we will use the [SendInput](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-sendinput) API to send a left mouse down event to the game. SendInput takes an array
of input events, which allows you to send multiple events. This can be
useful if we want to do multiple actions at once, such as attacking and
then casting a spell. In this lesson, we will only send one input, which is
the mouse down or mouse up event:

```c++
input.type = INPUT_MOUSE;
input.mi.dwFlags = MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN;
SendInput(1, &input, sizeof(INPUT));
```

We can now build this DLL and inject it into our game. In game, move to a
screen with an enemy and hold down the "M" key. Your character should run
toward the enemy and attack when close enough.
