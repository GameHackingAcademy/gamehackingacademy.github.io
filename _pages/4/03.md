# Target

In this lesson, we will switch our target to the game [Wyrmsun](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370070/Wyrmsun),
version 5.0.1. This is because Wesnoth, our target so far, does not
support gameplay mechanisms (such as real-time control of building units)
that would allow us to write a macro bot. Wyrmsun is free and similar to
other traditional RTS games, such as StarCraft, WarCraft, or Command &
Conquer.

# Identify

A macro bot is a type of hack that will monitor our resources and
automatically build worker units. In this lesson, we will create a macro bot
that will automatically build a worker out of the currently selected
structure when our money is over 3000.

# Understand

To write a macro bot, we need to understand how RTS games handle unit
creation. Typically, RTS games have a list of units associated with each
player. When creating a unit, the game performs several operations and
then adds the new unit to that list. The code may look something like:

```c++
recruit_unit(unit_type) {
  memory = initialize_memory(sizeof(unit))
  unit = create_unit(unit_type, memory)
  player->decrease_money()
  player->add_unit(unit)  
  player->increase_population_counter()      
}
```

To create units, we need to find this function and call it ourselves. To
locate this function, we can use two different approaches, depending on
how the game handles unit creation.

- If we create a unit and the game instantly decreases our money, we will
locate our money and then set a breakpoint on write on our money value.
- If we create a unit and the game instantly increases our population, we
will locate our population and then set a breakpoint on write on our
current population.

When these breakpoints trigger, we will be inside of the hypothetical
**decrease_money** or
**increase_population_counter** functions in our example code
above. We will therefore need to go up several functions. We will do this
by executing the function until it returns and then stepping out.

Wyrmsun (our target in this lesson) loads code dynamically. As a result, the
addresses you see in this lesson will be different when following along.
However, the instructions and methods described will not change. We will
discuss how to deal with this behavior when we create our DLL.

# Locating the Create Unit Function

In Wyrmsun, money is decreased instantly when recruiting a unit, so we
will use the first approach mentioned in the previous section. To find our
money address for this new target, we can use the method discussed in the [Memory Hack](/pages/1/05/) lesson.

Next, attach x64dbg to the game. Make sure that no operations are taking
place that will alter your money, and set a hardware breakpoint on write
on the money address. Recruit a worker and the breakpoint should instantly
pop. Using execute until return/step over, go up several levels of code
until you see the following string:

![Recruit unit function](/assets/images/4/3/macro2.png)

From this string, we can see that we are in the right place, as this logic
is clearly related to recruiting and placing units.

From here, navigate up one more level to the parent calling function:

![Recruit unit function](/assets/images/4/3/macro3.png)

If we examine this code, we can see it is a series of very similar calls
that take a single parameter. If we set a breakpoint on the
**call** to `0xF42CF7`, we can see that it is
called only when a unit is recruited. Next, place a breakpoint on the
**call** above the **call** to
`0xF42CF7`. With that set, do various actions in the game, such
as moving units, attacking, and building. When conducting a build action,
your breakpoint at the **call** above the unit recruitment
function should pop:

![Recruit unit function](/assets/images/4/3/macro7.png)

Given this behavior, we can guess that all these calls are related to
functions in the unit card (the bottom-right of the screen). We can
imagine the code may look something like:

```c++
switch(menu_event) {
  case BUILD:
    build_structure(event_data);
    break;
  case RECRUIT:
    recruit_unit(event_data);
    break;
  case MOVE:
    move_unit(event_data);
    break;
}
```

Therefore, we can assume the **call** to
`0xF42CF7` (in our example) is responsible for recruiting
units. We can verify this by **nop**’ing out the following
instructions:

```c++
push ecx
mov ecx, esi 
call 0xF42CF7
```

When **nop**’d out, clicking the recruit button on a
structure no longer creates a unit.

# Reversing Event Data Structure

Now that we have located the unit creation function, we need to reverse
the data provided to it so that we can call it ourselves. We can see that
there are two pieces of data potentially being passed to the function:

- A value in **ecx**, which is pushed on the stack
- A value in **esi**, which is moved into **ecx**

Let's determine if both of these are necessary. First, replace the
**push ecx** instruction with another register, such as
**push eax**. If you try to recruit a unit in the game, you
will notice the game will instantly crash, indicating that the push is
important. Next, restart the game and **nop** out the
**mov ecx, esi** instruction. You will notice that the game
responds normally, indicating that this operation is not used by the unit
creation event. As a result, we only need to reverse the value of
**ecx** when pushed.

Set a breakpoint on the **push ecx** and recruit a worker.
When the breakpoint pops, right-click on the value of
**ecx** and choose *Follow in dump:*

![Recruit unit function](/assets/images/4/3/macro4.png)

This data does not appear to contain all of the information we would
expect. The similar values of the data (the first three entries repeat
`0xb710` at their end) indicate that this may be a pointer in a
table of pointers. To validate this assumption, select the 4 bytes
(`0xf01db710`) and choose *Follow in dump*. Your dump view
should change to `0x10b71df0`, like so:

![Recruit unit function](/assets/images/4/3/macro5.png)

Immediately the text *worker* should jump out at you. It appears that
this structure contains data on the unit to be created. Back in game,
create another structure to create units (such as a War Hall, or
barracks-type building) and create an infantry unit. When the breakpoint
pops, examine the section of memory at `0x10b71df0` again:

![Recruit unit function](/assets/images/4/3/macro6.png)

We can see two main pieces of data changed between a worker and an
infantry unit being recruited: the text (*worker* vs *infantry*)
and the number beforehand (`0x41` vs `0x2c`). We can
assume that this number may be the internal representation of the type of
unit.

Let's verify that this works, as we are still guessing. First, set a
breakpoint on the **push ecx** and create an infantry unit.
Next, when the breakpoint pops, change `0x2C` to
`0x41` and *infantry* to *worker*. If you then resume
the execution and go back in game, you can see that despite clicking
infantry, we are now creating a worker out of the barracks structure.

There is also other data in this structure that changes but is not
directly tied to the unit being created. While we could reverse the entire
structure, we will instead copy the structure when a worker is created and
use those values for our hack.

# Locating the Main Game Loop

Now that we have located the function responsible for recruiting units and
understand how to call it, we need to locate a place to call it from. For
this lesson, we will choose to hook the main game loop. Finding the main game
loop is easy in our case. First, place a breakpoint on the
**call** to recruit a unit and create a unit in game so that
the breakpoint will pop. Next, continue to step out of each function.
Eventually, you will reach the following **call**:

![Recruit unit function](/assets/images/4/3/macro8.png)

If you attempt to execute until return here, you will notice the game will
begin and continue to execute. This is due to the fact that we are in a
loop and no **ret** instruction is being encountered. We can
verify this behavior by setting a breakpoint on this
**call**. You will notice the breakpoint pops continuously.
Both of these factors indicate that this code is part of the main game
loop.

# Locating the Player's Money

Finally, we want to monitor our player's money for our hack. Wyrmsun, like
other games, allocates a player's money dynamically, meaning it will be
different for each game. In previous lessons, we have discussed methods to
defeat DMA. For this lesson, we will use Cheat Engine's pointer scan feature
instead of reversing the target.

Cheat Engine's pointer scan works similar to regular memory scanning.
First, we need to locate our money address as usual. Then, right-click on
the address and choose *Pointer scan*:

![Recruit unit function](/assets/images/4/3/macro9.png)

In the dialog that appears, keep all the default options and choose
*OK*. When prompted, select a file anywhere:

![Recruit unit function](/assets/images/4/3/macro10.png)

Cheat Engine will now search the target for all pointers that point to the
selected address in some way. When it is finished, you will get thousands
of results back:

![Recruit unit function](/assets/images/4/3/macro11.png)

Like regular scanning, we now need to filter these addresses down. Restart
your match so that your goal is moved to a new address. Next, find your
money address again. Then, in the pointer scan window, choose
*Rescan Memory*:

![Recruit unit function](/assets/images/4/3/macro12.png)

In the dialog that appears, enter your new address and hit *OK*:

![Recruit unit function](/assets/images/4/3/macro13.png)

Like regular filtering, Cheat Engine will now rescan all the previously
identified pointers and see if they are still correctly pointing at your
new address. Repeat this operation several times, and eventually you will
find a few pointers that always correctly point to the player's money
value. For this lesson, we will use:

```c++
+0x14
[+0]
[+0x4]
[+0x8]
[+0x4]
[+0x78]
wyrmsun.exe + 0x0061A504
```

We will discuss how to use these values in our code, so feel free to
substitute in whatever value you find.

# Dealing with Dynamic Code

At the beginning of this lesson, we discussed how code was dynamically loaded
and, as a result, addresses would not be consistent. You can verify this
behavior by starting Wyrmsun, noting an address, restarting your VM, and
opening Wyrmsun again. You will notice that the address no longer contains
the same code.

Just like DMA, we know that the game must have some way to locate its
code. When dealing with dynamic code, generally games will offset all
addresses from the game's module base address. We can observe this
behavior by looking at the creating unit **call**. While the
first byte will change, the **call** always ends in
`0x2CF7` (e.g., `0xF42CF7` or
`0x292CF7`).

We can determine the base address of the main module by going into the
*Symbols* tab in x64dbg:

![Recruit unit function](/assets/images/4/3/macro14.png)

We can see here that our base address is `0x00F40000`. As such,
we know that the create unit function will exist at the
`base address + 0x2CF7`. Likewise, we saw that in this lesson, the
**call** to create unit was at `0x01163471`. If we
subtract this address from the base address, we get an offset of
`0x223471`. We can use these offsets when creating our DLL to
automatically calculate the addresses of functions we care about.

# Creating our DLL

Like in previous lessons, we will create a DLL to inject into our target.
First, we will start with our base:

```c++
#include <Windows.h>

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved) {
  DWORD old_protect;

  if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {
    //hooking code here
  }

  return true;
}
```

Our DLL will have two code caves. First, we will create a code cave at the
code responsible for creating a unit. In this code cave, we will retrieve
the value of **ecx** and copy the structure it points to into
our DLL's memory. Our second code cave will hook the main game loop. In
this code cave, we will check the current player's money value and then
call the create unit function.

# Create Unit Code Cave

When we reversed the create unit function, we identified the structure
that was pushed as an argument to the function. While we identified
several components of this structure, we did not fully reverse it. Since
this structure does not change when creating worker units, we will use a
code cave to copy a valid form of the structure. We will then use this
copied form in our main game loop code cave.

First, we will hook the address for creating a unit and direct it to our
code cave, as we have done in previous lessons. Since the code's addresses
change, we will determine the address based on the base address of the
module. We will also use this base address to calculate the recruit unit
call location:

```c++
HANDLE wyrmsun_base;

DWORD recruit_unit_ret_address;
DWORD recruit_unit_call_address;

... 

wyrmsun_base = GetModuleHandle(L"wyrmsun.exe");

unsigned char* hook_location = (unsigned char*)((DWORD)wyrmsun_base + 0x223471);
recruit_unit_ret_address = (DWORD)hook_location + 8;
recruit_unit_call_address = (DWORD)wyrmsun_base + 0x2CF7;

VirtualProtect((void*)hook_location, 8, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &old_protect);
*hook_location = 0xE9;
*(DWORD*)(hook_location + 1) = (DWORD)&recruit_unit_codecave - ((DWORD)hook_location + 5);
*(hook_location + 5) = 0x90;
*(hook_location + 6) = 0x90;
*(hook_location + 7) = 0x90;
```

In our recruit unit code cave, we will first retrieve the value of
**ecx** and place it in a variable:

```c++
DWORD* base;

__declspec(naked) void recruit_unit_codecave() {
  __asm {
    pushad
    mov base, ecx
  }
```

With this pointer now stored in the **base** variable, we can
dereference this pointer to retrieve the location of the structure. With
the pointer dereference, we can then copy the entire structure into
another variable to use in our other code cave. We can retrieve the size
by observing the size of the structure in x64dbg. Additionally, we will
create an **init** variable to track whether this has
occurred yet:

```c++
DWORD* unitbase;

unsigned char unitdata[0x110];
bool init = false;

... 

unitbase = (DWORD*)(*base);
memcpy(unitdata, unitbase, 0x110);
init = true;
```

Finally, we will restore our registers and the original instructions:

```c++
  _asm {
      popad
      push ecx
      mov ecx, esi
      call recruit_unit_call_address
      jmp recruit_unit_ret_address
    }
}
```

# Game Loop Code Cave

With our data copied into a buffer, we can now create our game loop code
cave. Like before, we will begin by hooking the address that we identified
earlier:

```c++
DWORD gameloop_ret_address;
DWORD gameloop_call_address;

hook_location = (unsigned char*)((DWORD)wyrmsun_base + 0x385D34);
gameloop_ret_address = (DWORD)hook_location + 5;
gameloop_call_address = (DWORD)wyrmsun_base + 0xDBCA;

VirtualProtect((void*)hook_location, 5, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &old_protect);
*hook_location = 0xE9;
*(DWORD*)(hook_location + 1) = (DWORD)&gameloop_codecave - ((DWORD)hook_location + 5);
```

In our game loop code cave, we will first check the value of our player's
money. We will use the pointer and offset that we received from Cheat
Engine to do this:

```c++
DWORD *gold_base, *gold;
...
__declspec(naked) void gameloop_codecave() {
  __asm {
    pushad
  }

  gold_base = (DWORD*)((DWORD)wyrmsun_base + 0x0061A504);
  gold = (DWORD*)(*gold_base + 0x78);
  gold = (DWORD*)(*gold + 4);
  gold = (DWORD*)(*gold + 8);
  gold = (DWORD*)(*gold + 4);
  gold = (DWORD*)(*gold);
  gold = (DWORD*)(*gold + 0x14);
```

Next, we will check to see if our unit buffer has been initialized and if
the player's money is over 3000. If so, we copy our buffer for the worker
into the buffer pointed to by the game, and move the base into
**ecx** before calling the recruit unit function:

```c++
if (init && *gold > 3000) {
  memcpy(unitbase, unitdata, 0x110);
  __asm {
    mov ecx, base
    push ecx
    call recruit_unit_call_address
  }
}
```

Once again, we need to restore the original instructions:

```c++
  __asm {
      popad
      call gameloop_call_address
      jmp gameloop_ret_address
    }
  }
```

Finally, we can build this DLL and inject it into our game. In game,
recruit a unit to copy our buffer and then start collecting money. You
should notice that workers begin to get recruited instantly.
