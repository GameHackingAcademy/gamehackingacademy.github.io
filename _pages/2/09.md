# Target
Our target in this lesson will be Wesnoth 1.14.9.

# Identify

Our goal in this lesson is to locate the base pointer for our Player class.
After that, we need to figure out how to offset our gold address from this
base pointer.

# Understand

When a player begins a game, Wesnoth uses DMA to allocate several values,
including the player's gold. This means that the player's gold address
will be at a different address for each game. By contrast, there are
several values that remain constant between games, like the player's
profile name. These constant values must be stored in some sort of Player
class. Since these values persist for every game, there must be a static
address that Wesnoth uses to locate them. If we can find this static
address, we can then offset to our dynamic gold address while in game.


To visualize this, let's imagine that Wesnoth's Player class looks
something like:

```c++
class Player {
    string player_name = "IEUser";
    int wins = 100;
    Game game = null;
}
```

And the Game class looks something like:
```c++
class Game {
    string side;
    int gold;
    int turn;
}
```

When a player enters a game, the game's code will allocate memory for this
game object and all the values that it contains:

```c++
player.game = new Game("Human", 100, 1);
```


By finding the value of the gold address, we can reverse the game to find
the value of the Game address for the current game. We can then use that
address to find the address of the Player class. Since the Player class is
always loaded, it will be a consistent address. From the Player class, we
can then use the addresses we found while reversing to offset to the
current gold address.

# Locating Gold

For the last time in these lessons, we will need to find the address of our
gold value. Our first step is opening up Wesnoth and creating a local
game. Unlike the previous lesson, make sure that you give yourself
*Income* to make the reversing process easier. Also, make sure the
second player is set to a *Computer* opponent.

Then follow the steps in the [Memory Hack](/pages/1/05/) lesson to
find your gold address. Once you have found your new gold address, close
down Cheat Engine but keep Wesnoth open.

# Base Pointer

Next, attach x64dbg to Wesnoth and set a breakpoint on write on the gold
address that you found. Unlike previous lessons, do not recruit a unit.
Instead, choose to end your turn. Upon ending your turn, your breakpoint
should pop as income is added to your gold.

![Breakpoint Triggered From Income](/assets/images/2/9/wesnoth2.png)

Let's briefly examine the instruction that our breakpoint popped on:

```c++
009B4D00 add dword ptr ds:[eax+4], edx
```

When this instruction is executed, **eax+4** holds the value
of our gold address (in this instance, `0x0D70B9AC`). Our next
step is to determine how **eax** is assigned. If we look
above the **add** instruction, we see several
**mov** instructions that reference the value of
**eax**. Above these, we have a
**call** instruction to an unknown function. To determine if
this function is responsible for setting **eax**, we can set
a breakpoint on this **call** and then resume Wesnoth. When
we end our turn again, this breakpoint will be hit.

![Breakpoint Triggered From Income](/assets/images/2/9/wesnoth3.png)

Observing the registers, we see that **eax** is set at 0
entering this function, meaning this function must be acquiring the
correct value for **eax**. We can confirm this by stepping
over the function and noting the new value of **eax**.

![Breakpoint Triggered From Income](/assets/images/2/9/wesnoth4.png)

With this confirmed, resume Wesnoth and end your turn again to trigger the
same breakpoint. This time, step into the function. After stepping through
a few lines, we see that **eax** is being set based on the
value of **ecx + 60**.

![Breakpoint Triggered From Income](/assets/images/2/9/wesnoth5.png)

For now, we will note that we need to determine the value of
**ecx**. However, **eax** is still not close to
the value of our gold address. Before we move on to determining the value
of **ecx**, we need to determine how **eax** is
modified from the initial assignment to reach the gold address. If we
continue down the function, we see that the value of `0xA90` is
being added to **eax**. After that, **edx** is
loaded with the value of **eax + 4**. Let's step to the
address after that code to see what value is being loaded into
**ecx**.

![Breakpoint Triggered From Income](/assets/images/2/9/wesnoth6.png)

We can see here that **ecx**'s value is only 4 away from our
gold address, identical to how the initial
**add** instruction referenced it. From this, we know so far
that **[[ecx + 60] + 0xA90] + 4** is our gold address. Our
next step is determining **ecx** at the start of this function.

When locating base pointers, it's important to stop each time a new
register or address is introduced and ensure that it is actually random.
To do this, first make a current note of **ecx**'s value when
it is loaded into **eax**. In this case, that value is
`0x017EECB8`. Next, make a note of the address of the
instruction that assigns the value so that you can place another
breakpoint here. In this case, it will be the
**mov** instruction at `0x009AE7F7`.

Now, detach x64dbg and then close Wesnoth. Once it is closed, start
Wesnoth again, recreate a game with the same income settings, and reattach
x64dbg. Place a breakpoint at the address noted (`0x009AE7F7`)
and then end your turn. When the breakpoint pops, observe the new value of
**ecx**. In this case, it's the exact same as the last time
(`0x017EECB8`). Therefore, we know that this must represent a
base pointer that doesn't change. If it did change, we would have to
continue with the reversing process.

# Change

With our base pointer found, we can now save its value for use in future
projects. From our reversing, we know that the value of the player's gold
in Wesnoth is always at: `[[0x017EECB8 + 0x60] + 0xA90] + 4`.
To simplify, we know that `0x017EECB8 + 0x60` will always be
`0x017EED18`, so the actual offset can be represented as:
`[[0x017EED18] + 0xA90] + 4`.

Cheat Engine allows us to manually add pointers with offsets as addresses.
We can use this to verify that our value is correct. First, open Cheat
Engine and attach it to Wesnoth. After attaching, select the
*Add Address Manually* button.

![Cheat Engine's Add Address Manually Feature](/assets/images/2/9/wesnoth7.png)

In the box that pops up, select the checkbox for *Pointer*. When
doing this, Cheat Engine will prompt you for a base address and one
offset. Type in `0x017EED18` as the base address and
`0xA90` as the offset. Then add another offset and type in 4.
This is all the information we found while reversing.

![Cheat Engine's Add Address Manually Feature](/assets/images/2/9/wesnoth8.png)

In the *Address box* at the top, you should notice that Cheat Engine
has correctly resolved our offset to the current amount of gold that we
have. If you close and restart Wesnoth, this pointer will then change to
the new value for gold.
