# Target

Our target in this lesson will be Wesnoth 1.14.9.

# Identify

In this lesson, we will create a C++ program that will modify a player's gold
in Wesnoth.

# Understand

In the [Defeating DMA](/pages/2/08/) lesson, we defeated DMA in
Wesnoth and located the player's base pointer at `0x017EECB8`.
We then determined the offsets necessary to locate the player's gold from
the base pointer. This allowed us to start at a static address, add a
series of static offsets, and reach a dynamic address.

Since these addresses and offsets are static, we can create a program to
perform this operation. We covered several approaches to do this in [Programming Fundamentals](/pages/3/01/) lesson. In this lesson, we
will create an external executable.

# Visual Studio

To create C++ programs, we need a compiler and a linker. A compiler is
used to turn high-level language code into opcodes. A linker is used to
then create an executable that the OS understands from these opcodes.
These two components are normally bundled into an Integrated Development
Environment, or IDE. IDE’s contain other components as well, such as
code-completion and interactive debugging. Visual Studio is an IDE that
Microsoft has released for Windows. The community edition is free to
download and use in personal projects. It can be installed using
Chocolatey, which we installed when first setting up the VM. To do so,
open up Command Prompt or Powershell and run the following command:

```powershell
choco install visualstudio2019community
```

In Visual Studio, source code files are contained within projects. Several
of these projects can be contained within a solution. For example, the
Visual Studio solution for Wesnoth might look like:

```
Game - Solution
    Engine - Project
        Player.cpp - Source Code
        main.cpp - Source Code
    UI - Project
    ...
    Network - Project
    ...
```

To create a C++ solution, we will first need to install some C++
components. This can be done by selecting the
*Install more tools and features* link, and then selecting
*Desktop development* with C++ in the wizard.

![C++ Desktop Development Package](/assets/images/3/2/ide1.png)

With these components installed, we can now create C++ projects and
compile them.

# Creating Projects

Once these components are installed, create an empty C++ project and name
it *ExternalMemoryHack*.

![C++ Empty Project](/assets/images/3/2/ide2.png)

With the new project created, we can now add our source code file that
will contain all of our code. To do this, right-click on
*Source Files* and select *Add* -> *New Item*:

![Visual Studio Add File](/assets/images/3/2/ide3.png)

In the modal that appears, choose *C++ File* and name it
*main.cpp*:

![Visual Studio Add File](/assets/images/3/2/ide4.png)

With the project and source file created, we can now begin programming.

# C++ Basics

C++ has many features and is a versatile language. For our purposes, we
will focus on the most important ones for creating hacks. For this lesson, we
need to know two things about the language:

1. Programs start at a function called **main**. This function has to return a value.
1. Programs can call other functions built into Windows.

Any C++ executable needs to have a **main** function that
returns an integer. This function takes two parameters, which are not
important to know at the moment. When executed, the OS looks for and
executes this function. When the function returns, it signals to the OS
that the program is finished executing.

In addition to functions we create, we can call other functions that are
built into Windows. Windows has many API’s to do things like displaying
text, playing sounds, and creating files. Windows also has API’s that
allow us to read and write values to an address in a process. These are
what we will use to create our hack.

To use these functions, we need to include certain header files. Header
files contain definitions for functions that are defined outside of our
source file. To read and write memory, we will need to include the header
file **Windows.h**.

# Reading Values

We need to read several values in Wesnoth to locate our gold value. The
API to read another process's memory is called
**ReadProcessMemory**. If you google this name, the first
result will be [documentation by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-readprocessmemory). This documentation describes how the API works, including what
parameters it takes and what values it returns.

By examining this documentation, we can determine what values we need to
provide. For any values we still need, we can then determine how to get
them.

**ReadProcessMemory**'s function definition is:
```c++
BOOL ReadProcessMemory(
    HANDLE  hProcess,
    LPCVOID lpBaseAddress,
    LPVOID  lpBuffer,
    SIZE_T  nSize,
    SIZE_T  *lpNumberOfBytesRead
);
```

Looking at the code block above, we can start at the first parameter and
work our way down to determine what values we need. First, we do not have
a handle to a process, so we will need to find that. We will discuss how
to do this in the next section. We have the base address (in this case,
our base pointer). The buffer needs to be provided by us, so we will need
to create that. The size parameter will be the size of the data to read.
In this case, the size will be 4 bytes, due to the size of the registers
we saw while reversing. Finally, we will need to create another variable
to hold the number of bytes actually read when the function is executed.

You may want to read the [Win32 Coding Style Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/stg/coding-style-conventions). While this might seem overwhelming, this gives us a starting point to
understanding the Windows API and writing our first program. First, we know that we need to include
**Windows.h** so that we can use
**ReadProcessMemory**:

```c++
#include <Windows.h>
```

Next, since this is a C++ executable, we will create our
**main** function:

```c++
int main(int argc, char** argv) {

    return 0;
}
```

Finally, in the **main** function, above the
**return** statement, we can insert our call to
**ReadProcessMemory**. For values we don't have yet, we will
put in a variable name. As we figure out how to retrieve these values, we
can then assign these variables.

```c++
ReadProcessMemory(wesnoth_process, 0x017EECB8, gold_value, 4, bytes_read);
```

Both the **gold_value** and
**bytes_read** values are provided by us and populated by the
API. Therefore, we need to initialize two variables to hold these values.
Since we are reading 4 bytes, these variables need to be large enough to
hold amounts of this size. One option to accomplish this is to use a
**DWORD**, which is [32 bits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dtyp/262627d8-3418-4627-9218-4ffe110850b2) (or 4 bytes) long. We need to place these declarations above the call to
**ReadProcessMemory**:

```c++
DWORD gold_value = 0;
DWORD bytes_read = 0;
```

Since both of these parameters are expected to be pointers, we need to
also change our **ReadProcessMemory** call. Instead of
passing the variable's value, we need to pass the address of these
variables using **&**:

```c++
ReadProcessMemory(wesnoth_process, 0x017EECB8, &gold_value, 4, &bytes_read);
```

# Opening Processes

Our next step is retrieving a process handle. To do this, we can use an
API called [OpenProcess](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess). The definition for this API is:

```c++
HANDLE OpenProcess(
    DWORD dwDesiredAccess,
    BOOL  bInheritHandle,
    DWORD dwProcessId
);
```

From this definition, we see that **OpenProcess** returns a
handle to a process. This handle can be used as the first parameter for
**ReadProcessMemory**. Looking at the documentation, we want
our desired access to be **PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS**, so that we
can both read and write to the process. The second parameter does not
matter for what we are doing, so we will set it to the value of true. We
will need to find the last parameter, so for now, we will create a
variable. Since we need the result of this function to call
**ReadProcessMemory**, we will place the call to it above
**ReadProcessMemory**. Our code should now look like:

```c++
HANDLE wesnoth_process = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, true, process_id);

DWORD gold_value = 0;
DWORD bytes_read = 0;
ReadProcessMemory(wesnoth_process, 0x017EECB8, &gold_value, 4, &bytes_read);
```

Next, we will retrieve a **process_id** for the OpenProcess
call. Similar to the previous two API’s, we will use another API and then
fill in any information we need. In this case, the API will be [GetWindowThreadProcessId.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getwindowthreadprocessid) This API retrieves a process ID when provided with a window handle,
which is different than a process handle. The definition for this API is:

```c++
DWORD GetWindowThreadProcessId(
    HWND    hWnd,
    LPDWORD lpdwProcessId
);
```

This function requires a handle to a window and a variable to hold the
process ID. Just like before, we will add this code above our call to
**OpenProcess**:

```c++
DWORD process_id = 0;
GetWindowThreadProcessId(wesnoth_window, &process_id);
```

To get a window handle, we can use the API [FindWindow.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-findwindowa) This function takes the name of a window title and returns a handle to the
window. The definition is:

```c++
HWND FindWindowA(
    LPCSTR lpClassName,
    LPCSTR lpWindowName
);
```

Since we want to search all windows, we will set the first parameter to
**NULL**. For the second parameter, we know the name of the
Wesnoth window, as it is displayed in the game's title bar. We can insert
this final call at the top of our **main** function. Right
now, our code will look like:

```c++
#include <Windows.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    HWND wesnoth_window = FindWindow(NULL, "The Battle for Wesnoth - 1.14.9");

    DWORD process_id = 0;
    GetWindowThreadProcessId(wesnoth_window, &process_id);

    HANDLE wesnoth_process = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, true, process_id);

    DWORD gold_value = 0;
    DWORD bytes_read = 0;
    ReadProcessMemory(wesnoth_process, 0x017EECB8, &gold_value, 4, &bytes_read);
    return 0;
}
```

# Casting Parameters

Visual Studio will display several errors for the code we have written.
This is because we have not properly casted two of our variables. As a
result, the compiler cannot understand how we want to pass data to a
function. If we want to compile our program, we will need to fix these
errors. Luckily, by reading the *Error List* in Visual Studio, we can
determine what we need to do to fix these errors.

![Project Errors](/assets/images/3/2/ide5.png)

Let's address the two **ReadProcessMemory** errors that occur
on *Line 13* of the code. The first error for *Line 13* is
*argument of type "int" is compatible with parameter type "LPCVOID"*.
This indicates that we have a parameter that is an integer that is
supposed to be a **LPCVOID**. The second error,
*cannot convert argument 2 from 'int' to 'LPCVOID'*, indicates which
parameter this is. *Argument 2* is our address
`0x017EECB8`. If we google **LPCVOID**, the [first result is Microsoft's documentation regarding LPCVOID.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dtyp/66996877-9dd4-477d-a811-30e6c1a5525d) The documentation shows us that **LPCVOID** is defined as a
**void***:

```c++
typedef const void* LPCVOID;
```

To solve these errors, we can cast our address as a
**void***. The resulting code looks like:

```c++
ReadProcessMemory(wesnoth_process, (void*)0x017EECB8, &gold_value, 4, &bytes_read);
```

With this, those errors will disappear. Now we can examine the second set
of errors that occur on *Line 4*, regarding the
**FindWindow** call. These errors indicate that the
**The Battle for Wesnoth - 1.14.9** string is not cast
correctly. It is a **const char*** and needs to be cast as a
**LPCWSTR**. To do this, we can prefix the string with an
**L**. Our **FindWindow** call now looks like:

```c++
HWND wesnoth_window = FindWindow(NULL, L"The Battle for Wesnoth - 1.14.9");
```

After making this change, the errors will disappear and we can now compile
and execute our program. To do this, go to the *Build* menu item and
select *Build Solution*. Once this completes, we will have a program
that we can execute.

![Build Menu](/assets/images/3/2/ide6.png)

# Debugging

To verify that this code works, we need to make sure that we are actually
reading the correct value at the memory address `0x017EECB8`.
To do this, we will debug our program inside Visual Studio and compare the
results of our **ReadProcessMemory** call against Cheat
Engine.

First, open up Cheat Engine and manually add the address
`0x017EECB8`. Then, set a breakpoint on the
**ReadProcessMemory** line. This can be done by left-clicking
on the area to the left of the line of code you wish to breakpoint. If
done correctly, a red circle will appear.

![Build Menu](/assets/images/3/2/ide7.png)

Next, click on the *Local Windows Debugger* button at the top of the
IDE. This will begin executing our program with a debugger attached.

![Visual Studio Debugger](/assets/images/3/2/ide8.png)

Since we have written the source code, debugging our program will be far
easier than debugging Wesnoth. When our breakpoint is reached, the
debugger will pop and let us explore various elements of the code,
including our variables. These variables will be shown in the bottom left
of the IDE. To make sure we are reading memory correctly, we want to look
at the **gold_value** variable and make sure its value
matches Cheat Engine.

![Visual Studio Debugger](/assets/images/3/2/ide9.png)

Since the values match, we know that we are correctly reading memory in
Wesnoth. Hit the *Continue* button at the top of the IDE to finish
executing our program. Now we can move on to finding our gold value.

# DMA

Since we can read memory, we can now retrieve our gold value. In [Defeating DMA](/pages/2/08/) lesson, we determined that our gold
address is stored at `[[0x017EECB8 + 0x60] + 0xA90] + 4`. This
can be further simplified to `[[0x017EED18] + 0xA90] + 4`. To
retrieve the gold address in our program, we can first read the value at
`0x017EED18`, then add `0xA90` to that value. We can
then read this address and add 4 to it. Once we have done that, we will
have our gold address.

To do this entire process, we can use the
**ReadProcessMemory** call identically to our previous code.
First, we will read in the value of `[[0x017EED18] + 0xA90]`.

```c++
DWORD gold_value = 0;
DWORD bytes_read = 0;
ReadProcessMemory(wesnoth_process, (void*)0x017EED18, &gold_value, 4, &bytes_read);

gold_value += 0xA90;
ReadProcessMemory(wesnoth_process, (void*)gold_value, &gold_value, 4, &bytes_read);
```

We can use Cheat Engine to examine offsets to ensure that we are reading
the value correctly. We can then use a breakpoint on the second
**ReadProcessMemory** call to ensure that the values match.
Since Visual Studio displays variables in a decimal format, we will need
to convert these numbers to hexadecimal to check.

![ReadProcessMemory and Cheat Engine](/assets/images/3/2/ide10.png)

Since our values match, we can add a final offset of 4 to the address to
retrieve our gold address. Next, we will focus on writing memory.

```c++
gold_value += 4;
```
# Writing Memory

The API to write to another process's memory is called [WriteProcessMemory.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory) Its definition is very similar to **ReadProcessMemory**:

```c++
BOOL WriteProcessMemory(
    HANDLE  hProcess,
    LPVOID  lpBaseAddress,
    LPCVOID lpBuffer,
    SIZE_T  nSize,
    SIZE_T  *lpNumberOfBytesWritten
);
```

The major difference is that this function writes the value of a buffer
into a section of a memory, instead of reading a section of memory into a
buffer. Like before, we will need to declare two variables for the buffer
and the number of bytes written.

```c++
DWORD new_gold_value = 555;
DWORD bytes_written = 0;
```

Then, we can call **WriteProcessMemory** in an almost
identical manner to **ReadProcessMemory**. Like with
**ReadProcessMemory**, we will cast our
**gold_value** to **(void*)**:

```c++
WriteProcessMemory(wesnoth_process, (void*)gold_value, &new_gold_value, 4, &bytes_written);
```

When this is executed, our gold will be set to 555 and our hack will be
complete. We can now run this executable whenever we want to change our
gold. We can also distribute it to other players to execute on their
machines.
