# Target

Our target in this lesson will be Wesnoth 1.14.9.

# Identify

In this lesson, we will print our own text in Wesnoth. To accomplish this
task, we will first locate a section of code responsible for printing
text. Then, we will use a code cave to modify the game's memory to display
our text.

# Understand

There are multiple approaches to print our own text inside a game:

1. Use an external overlay.
1. Create a code cave inside the game's main display loop and call the function responsible for displaying text.
1. Create a code cave inside a function responsible for displaying text and modify the text about to be displayed.

Different games are suited best for different methods. For this lesson, we
will use the third approach as it is the easiest to do in Wesnoth. We will
examine the other approaches more in-depth in future lessons.

# Locating Text

Our first task is to locate the game's code that is responsible for
displaying text. To start, we need to find a string of letters that
appears in the game. For Wesnoth, we can use the
*Terrain Description* text that is displayed when clicking on a tile.
Any description will work, but for this lesson, we will use the description
for the *Ford* tile. For other games, chat messages are a good
starting location.

First, select a map that has *Ford* tiles on it.
*Den of Onis* is one example:

![Map with ford tiles on it](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth1.png)

When the map loads, select a *Ford* tile and select the
*Terrain Description* entry on the context menu:

![Terrain description on a ford tile](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth2.png)

This will bring up the description for the tile, which contains a long
string of text:

![Terrain description on a ford tile](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth3.png)

We can use Cheat Engine to search for where this text is stored within the
game. Make sure to close down the terrain description box before searching
to reduce the amount of results. Due to the unique nature of the text, we
only need to search for a couple words:

![Searching for text in Cheat Engine](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth4.png)

To narrow down which address represents the string we are interested in,
change the first letter of every string. After changing these values, go
back into Wesnoth and examine the terrain description again. The version
of the string that is displayed in game will match up with the correct
address. In this case, the string starting with *Lhen* was displayed,
making our address `0x10CE996B`.

# Locating PrintText

We can now use the address we found to locate the function responsible for
printing text. We know that the print text function must access this text
in some way to print it. To determine where this function is, we can set a
breakpoint on a byte of the text.

![Breakpoint on text byte](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth6.png)

With the breakpoint set, go back into Wesnoth and invoke the
*Terrain Description* action again. Your breakpoint will pop
immediately:

![Breakpoint on text byte](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth7.png)

Examining this code, we appear to be in a loop responsible for moving each
byte of the text into a buffer. Like we did in previous lessons, we want to
navigate to the code that called this lower-level code by using execute
until return and stepping out.

![Breakpoint on text byte](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth8.png)

This call looks like it could be responsible for populating the terrain
description box with text. If we continue execution, we notice that this
code is called multiple times for each section of the terrain description
box. To determine the parameters passed to this call, we can set a
breakpoint on `0x005ED114` and invoke the
*Terrain Description* action again:

![Breakpoint on text byte](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth9.png)

The highlighted section shows that the text is loaded into the register
**edx**. The code at `0x005ED11A` then moves the
value in **edx** into the location pointed at by
**esp**. This is identical to pushing the value of
**edx** on the top of the stack. While we have not discussed
the stack yet, for the purpose of this lesson, we need to know that functions
will often retrieve values off of the stack for use in execution.

# Memory and Endianness

You may have noticed that the address in **edx** does not
match the address we found in Cheat Engine. Since the text space is
dynamically allocated, we will need to understand how to retrieve the
value of the text from **edx** to create our code cave.

Invoke the *Terrain Description* action again to force our breakpoint
to pop. Once it does, right-click on the value of **edx** and
choose *Follow in Dump*:

![Follow in dump action](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth10.png)

This will change the current address displaying in the dump to the value
of **edx**. As we discussed in previous lessons, the dump
section displays the current running memory of a process. It's important
to remember that both the dump section and Cheat Engine are displaying and
searching the same data.

![Dump section](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth11.png)

This value stored in **edx** is obviously not a text string.
However, if we examine the value of the bytes, we see that they share many
similarities to the address we found in Cheat Engine. In the previous lesson,
we briefly discussed a concept known as endianness. Most Windows-based
CPUâ€™s are little endian. By definition, this means that the
least-significant byte is stored in the smallest address.

In practice, this means that when the address `0x12345678` is
stored in memory, it will be stored as `0x78 56 34 12`. In this
case, `0x78` represents the least-significant byte, or the
smallest value. A good comparison is to imagine the number 123. Expressed
in a longer form, this value can be understood as 1*100 + 2*10 + 3*1. The
smallest value in this form is the number 3.

The second part of this definition can be understood by examining the
dump. In the dump, memory addresses grow from a lower value to a higher
value. Because of this, the least-significant byte will be stored "first"
in memory. The combination of these factors make addresses stored in
memory appear to be "reversed".

Now that we understand endianness, we can conclude that the value stored
at **edx** is an address. We can quickly navigate to this
address in the dump by selecting all the bytes and selecting
*Follow in Dump* again:

![Dump section](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth12.png)

After selecting this, we arrive at our string's location in memory:

![Dump section](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth13.png)

To reference this value in assembly, we can make use of the
**ptr ds** keyword:

```c++
mov eax, dword ptr ds:[edx]
```

This will load the value of the address stored in
**edx** into **eax**. In this case, it would
load the value `0x10CE9968` into **eax**. We could
then use the **ptr ds** keyword again to access the
individual bytes of the text.

# Changing Text

With this reversing done, we can start creating our hack. To verify that
we have the correct method, we will create a code cave that will change
the text displayed each time the *Terrain Description* action is
invoked. To do this simply, we will increase the value of the first byte
each time our code cave is executed. This will change the value of the
character and allow us to confirm that our hack is working.

Since we know the **call** at `0x005ED129` is
responsible for printing the text and is also 5 bytes long, we will use it
as our redirection point. As discussed in previous code cave lessons, any
location near the end of program's memory will work for our cave location.
In this case, we will create it at `0x01343E1B`. As usual, we
will replace the hooking location with a jump to our code cave:

![Redirection](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth14.png)

We will first save the registers in our code cave. Then we will use the
**ptr ds** keyword to load the value of the text from
**edx** into **eax**. After that, we will use
the **inc** operator to increase the value of the first byte
of the string. For example, if the first byte is currently A (ASCII value
65), it will be increased to B (ASCII value 66). Finally, we will restore
the registers, recreate the **call**, and then jump back to
the original code.

![Redirection](/assets/images/3/5/wesnoth15.png)

With this completed, go back into Wesnoth and invoke the
*Terrain Description* action multiple times. You will notice that a
character after the image changes each time, demonstrating that we have
successfully modified the text displayed.
