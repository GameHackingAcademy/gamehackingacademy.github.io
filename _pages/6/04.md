# Target

Our target in this lesson will be Wesnoth 1.14.9.

# Identify

In the previous lesson, we reversed the structure of a Wesnoth chat packet
and identified the steps needed to reverse and create chat packets for the
game. In this lesson, we will expand on this work to create a chat bot, a
type of bot that will wait for and respond to certain commands.

# Understand

In the previous lesson, we determined that the process to reverse a packet
went like this:

1. Retrieve the packet's data.
1. Split the data into two sections: size and compressed content.
1. Decompress the second section.

We used that technique on a chat packet and retrieved structured data that
looked like:

```c++
[message]
  message="a"
  room="lobby"
  sender="FFFAAAKKKEEE"
[/message]
```

Once we retrieved this data, we could make modifications and use a similar
process to create a new packet:

1. Compress the data section.
1. Add the section's length to the front of the data section.
1. Send the packet with the new data.

Since we can write both of the above processes out as a series of concrete
steps, we can create a program to automatically perform them for us. In
the retrieval process, we can analyze the content of each retrieved packet
and look for certain characters. If we identify these characters, we can
act on them.

# ZLib Installation

The data in the packets was compressed using gzip. While we could write
our own functions to manage gzip'd data, there are external libraries that
already provide functionality to compress and decompress gzip'd data in
C++. External libraries generally contain two parts: header files to
include in your code, and library files that contain the actual code. For
this lesson, we will use a library called [ZLib.](https://zlib.net/) Most of these libraries require
additional installation steps to fully work, including ZLib.

To set up ZLib, first download the *Complete package* installer from [their site](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zlib.htm) under the *zlib for Windows 9x/NT* entry. Once installed, it should
create a directory at *C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32*.

This installation placed several header and library files in this
directory. To use these, we need to include them in our Visual Studio
project. Open up Visual Studio and create a project. Once created,
right-click on the project file and choose *Properties*:

![Visual Studio Project Files](/assets/images/6/4/chat1.png)

First, we will make sure that our project can find the ZLib include files.
In the properties dialog, choose *C/C++* ->
*Additional Include Directories* -> *Edit*:

![Visual Studio Project Files](/assets/images/6/4/chat2.png)

In the dialog box that appears, choose the *New folder* icon and
browse to *C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\include*:

![Visual Studio Project Files](/assets/images/6/4/chat3.png)

We can now include *zlib.h* inside our code, and the build process
will be able to locate the file. However, as we have seen in previous
labs, header files generally only contain function definitions and do not
contain the majority of code. In ZLib, this code is stored in library
files. We will include these library files in a similar manner.

Select *Linker* -> *General* and then select
*Additional Library Directories* -> *Edit*:

![Visual Studio Project Files](/assets/images/6/4/chat4.png)

Like we just did, choose the *New folder* icon. This time, supply the
path to the library folder at *C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\lib*:

![Visual Studio Project Files](/assets/images/6/4/chat5.png)

Now that we have loaded the library folder, we need to include the actual
.lib file. In *Linker* -> *Input*, select
*Additional Dependencies* and add *zlib.lib* in the dialog that
appears:

![Visual Studio Project Files](/assets/images/6/4/chat6.png)

With all this setup done, we can now include ZLib in our code like a
regular header:

```c++
#include <zlib.h>
```

However, if we try to build this code, we will get the following build
error:

![Visual Studio Project Files](/assets/images/6/4/chat7.png)

If we double-click on this error, we are directed to the following code
block:

```c++
#if 1           /* HAVE_UNISTD_H -- this line is updated by ./configure */
#  include <sys/types.h> /* for off_t */
#  include <unistd.h>    /* for SEEK_* and off_t */
#  ifdef VMS
```

unistd.h is a Unix specific file. To fix this error, we can change the
**#if 1** to **#if HAVE_UNISTD_H**, like so:

![Visual Studio Project Files](/assets/images/6/4/chat8.png)

With these changes, our program will now build. However, if you run the
program, you will encounter a missing DLL error. To fix this, copy over
the *zlib1.dll* file to the running directory of your application:

![Visual Studio Project Files](/assets/images/6/4/chat9.png)

We can now build and run programs that contain ZLib functionality.

# Sending Data

Now that we can compress data in our code, we can create a function to
send a Wesnoth-structured packet with whatever data we would like. To
create the packet, this function will need our data and the length of this
data. To send the packet, we will need a socket. With these requirements,
we can create our function definition:

```c++
void send_data(const unsigned char *data, size_t len, SOCKET s) {
```

Based on the [documentation,](https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/libzman.html) the easiest way to use ZLib to produce gzip'd data is to create a file
with the compressed data. We can do this using the
**gzopen**, **gzwrite**, and
**gzclose** functions. These are similar to the regular file
functions **fopen**, **fwrite**, and
**fclose**. In our case, we will create a single compressed
file, **packet.gz**, and write whatever data is passed into
this file:

```c++
gzFile temp_data = gzopen("packet.gz", "wb");
gzwrite(temp_data, data, len);
gzclose(temp_data);
```

We can test our current implementation via:

```c++
const unsigned char version[] = "[test]hello[/test]";
send_data(version, sizeof(version), ConnectSocket);
```

Running this code will produce a packet.gz file in the same directory that
you ran the program from. If you use gzip to decompress the packet.gz
file, you will find that it contains **[test]hello[/test]**,
showing that our code works so far.

Our packet needs to contain the byte representation of this file. To
retrieve this, we can read the file as a binary file:

```c++
#define DEFAULT_BUFLEN 512
...
FILE* temp_file = NULL;
fopen_s(&temp_file, "packet.gz", "rb");

if (temp_file) {
  size_t compress_len = 0;
  unsigned char buffer[DEFAULT_BUFLEN] = { 0 };
  compress_len = fread(buffer, 1, sizeof(buffer), temp_file);
  fclose(temp_file);
```

If you run this code and set a breakpoint after **fclose**,
you will see that the buffer now contains the byte representation of the
compressed file. We can use this to build our packet. We know that the
first 4 bytes (a **DWORD**) of the packet represent the
packet's size. Since all of the chat packets are small, we only need to
write the size to the last byte of this **DWORD**. Since
buffers start at 0 in C, we reference this position with
**+3**. We will write the buffer containing the compressed
data after that:

```c++
unsigned char buff_packet[DEFAULT_BUFLEN] = { 0 };
memcpy(buff_packet + 3, &compress_len, sizeof(compress_len));
memcpy(buff_packet + 4, buffer, compress_len);
```

Next, we will use the code we have seen before to send a packet containing
this data:

```c++
int iResult = send(s, (const char*)buff_packet, compress_len + 4, 0);
printf("Bytes Sent: %ld\n", iResult);
```

To verify that this method works, we will build off the code we wrote in
the previous lesson. In this code, we sent three packets to connect to the
server: an initial negotiation packet that contained 0's, a packet
containing our client's version, and a packet containing our username.

We can use the same technique that we used to decode chat messages to
decode these packets. For example, the packet containing our version looks
like this after decoding:

```c++
[version]
  version="1.14.9"
[/version]
```

Instead of sending the packet's bytes like we were doing, we can use our
new function:

```c++
const unsigned char version[] = "[version]\nversion=\"1.14.9\"\n[/version]";
send_data(version, sizeof(version), ConnectSocket);
```

If you build and run this code, you will see that our bot will connect in
the same way, verifying that our function works. We can build on this
approach to send a custom username:

```c++
const unsigned char name[] = "[login]\nusername=\"ChatBot\"\n[/login]";
send_data(name, sizeof(name), ConnectSocket);
```

Finally, we can use the same method to send an initial chat message when
we connect:

```c++
const unsigned char first_message[] = "[message]\nmessage=\"ChatBot connected\"\nroom=\"lobby\"\nsender=\"ChatBot\"\n[/message]";
send_data(first_message, sizeof(first_message), ConnectSocket);
```

This is the same chat message structure that we observed in the previous
lab.

# Retrieving Data

We can now send chat messages. For our chatbot to work, we also need to
retrieve messages from the server and parse them for certain text. For
this lesson, we will have our bot respond to any message that contains
**\wave** with a chat message that says
**hello** back.

At the bottom of the code from Microsoft is a loop that continuously
checks for new packets. We can modify this to send retrieved packets to
our own function, and, depending on the contents, send a chat message:

```c++
do {
  iResult = recv(ConnectSocket, (char*)recvbuf, recvbuflen, 0);
  if (iResult > 0)
    printf("Bytes received: %d\n", iResult);
  else if (iResult == 0)
    printf("Connection closed\n");
  else
    printf("recv failed with error: %d\n", WSAGetLastError());

  if (parse_data(recvbuf, iResult)) {
    const unsigned char message[] = "[message]\nmessage=\"Hello!\"\nroom=\"lobby\"\nsender=\"ChatBot\"\n[/message]";
    send_data(message, sizeof(message), ConnectSocket);
  }
} while (iResult > 0);
```

Our **parse_data** function will take a data buffer and its
length, and return true if **\wave** is found.

```c++
bool parse_data(unsigned char *buff, int buff_len) {
```

Like we described above, this function will do the same steps as the
**send_data** function, but in the opposite order. First, we
will extract the compressed data from the packet and write it to a file:

```c++
unsigned char data[DEFAULT_BUFLEN] = { 0 };
memcpy(data, buff + 4, buff_len - 4);

FILE* temp_file = NULL;
fopen_s(&temp_file, "packet_recv.gz", "wb");

if (temp_file) {
  fwrite(data, 1, sizeof(data), temp_file);
  fclose(temp_file);
}
```

With the compressed data saved, we can use the **gzopen** and
**gzread** to read the decompressed data into a variable. We
will then write this variable to the terminal using
**fwrite**:

```c++
gzFile temp_data_in = gzopen("packet_recv.gz", "rb");
unsigned char decompressed_data[DEFAULT_BUFLEN] = { 0 };
gzread(temp_data_in, decompressed_data, DEFAULT_BUFLEN);
fwrite(decompressed_data, 1, DEFAULT_BUFLEN, stdout);
gzclose(temp_data_in);
```

Finally, we will check if the data contains the text
**\wave** using **strstr**. This function
returns a positive value if the second parameter is included in the first
parameter. It returns 0 if not. Because of this, we can return the value
of the search and use that to signify to our calling code that the text
was found:

```c++
return strstr((const char*)decompressed_data, (const char*)"\\wave");
```
