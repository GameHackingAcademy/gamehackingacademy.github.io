# Target

Our target in this lesson will be Wesnoth 1.14.9.

# Overview

In the previous lesson, we created an external client that would connect to a
Wesnoth server and listen for and respond to specific chat messages. A
major downside to this approach is that we had to reverse the entire
authentication process so that our client could connect to the server. Our
goal in this lesson is to create a proxy. This will allow us to use a regular
game client and only intercept and modify the traffic we care about from
the client.

# Reason for Proxying

The best way to understand our purpose for creating a proxy is to observe
the network traffic when connecting to a server with two clients on the
same host. On your lesson machine, start a Wesnoth server and connect to it
with a legitimate copy of the game. Next, modify the client that we wrote
in the previous lesson and remove all the authentication. Instead, have it
simply send a chat message:

```c++
...
freeaddrinfo(result);

if (ConnectSocket == INVALID_SOCKET) {
  printf("Unable to connect to server!\n");
  WSACleanup();
  return 1;
}

const unsigned char first_message[] = "[message]\nmessage=\"ChatBot connected\"\nroom=\"lobby\"\nsender=\"ChatBot\"\n[/message]";
send_data(first_message, sizeof(first_message), ConnectSocket);
...
```

Finally, open up Wireshark and start monitoring for traffic on the local
adapter, as we have discussed in previous lessons. When you start the
modified external client, you should see the following error on the
server:

![Failed handshake](/assets/images/6/5/proxy1.png)

We are familiar with this error from our initial analysis, so we know that
it occurs when we do not provide a valid handshake. Even though both our
game and external client are running on the same machine, they have
different sockets and are treated as completely separate connections by
the server:

![Failed handshake](/assets/images/6/5/proxy2.png)

If we examine the Wireshark traffic from the game client and our external
client, we can observe this behavior. While the game is busy sending
traffic on port 51120, we can see the TCP handshake of our external client
on port 51123:

![Failed handshake](/assets/images/6/5/proxy3.png)

If we want to intercept and modify a game's client traffic, we will need
to use a different approach.

# Proxying Traffic

When using TCP, we know that a connection is established between a client
and server after completing a handshake. To intercept and inject our own
traffic into this connection, the easiest approach is to be a
man-in-the-middle (MitM) of this connection.

At this position, we can modify requests from the client before they are
sent to the server, as well as responses from the server before they are
sent to the client. This is commonly known as a proxy, or an agent that
simply relays traffic from a source to a destination. A visualization of
this model is shown below:

![Failed handshake](/assets/images/6/5/proxy4.png)

The key to this model is that our proxy is acting as the server to the
client and the client to the server. This means that the server completes
a handshake with our proxy, allowing us to inject whatever traffic we
want. Since we are forwarding legitimate traffic from the client, we do
not need to reverse traffic (such as the authentication mechanism) because
the client will handle that for us.

A proxy consists of three main sections of code:
1. A socket to listen for client traffic
1. A socket to send traffic to the server
1. Logic to relay traffic from the client to the server and the server to
the client

To simplify this lesson, we will create a proxy that will respond to the
\wave event, identical to the external client we wrote in the previous
lab. For these operations, the Wesnoth client must send data to the server
for the server to respond. When using a proxy for other operations,
additional logic will need to be added in to pass server traffic to the
client.

The full code for this lesson is available on [github.](https://github.com/GameHackingAcademy/Wesnoth_Proxy/)

# Listening for Client Traffic

To listen for client traffic, we will create a listen socket. Once we
receive a connection, we will establish a connection with the client. To
do this, we can build off the [Microsoft server example:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/complete-server-code)

```c++
#define DEFAULT_PORT "27015"

WSADATA wsaData;
int iResult;

SOCKET ListenSocket = INVALID_SOCKET;
SOCKET ClientSocket = INVALID_SOCKET;

struct addrinfo* result = NULL,
hints;

iResult = WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 2), &wsaData);

ZeroMemory(&hints, sizeof(hints));
hints.ai_family = AF_INET;
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
hints.ai_protocol = IPPROTO_TCP;
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;

iResult = getaddrinfo(NULL, DEFAULT_PORT, &hints, &result);
ListenSocket = socket(result->ai_family, result->ai_socktype, result->ai_protocol);
iResult = bind(ListenSocket, result->ai_addr, (int)result->ai_addrlen);
freeaddrinfo(result);

iResult = listen(ListenSocket, SOMAXCONN);
ClientSocket = accept(ListenSocket, NULL, NULL);
closesocket(ListenSocket);
```

This will create a socket on port 27015 that will accept a single
connection.

# Sending Traffic to Server

For sending traffic to the server, we can build off the code that we
already discussed in the previous lesson:

```c++
SOCKET ServerSocket = INVALID_SOCKET;

ZeroMemory(&hints, sizeof(hints));
hints.ai_family = AF_INET;
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
hints.ai_protocol = IPPROTO_TCP;

iResult = getaddrinfo("127.0.0.1", "15000", &hints, &result);
ServerSocket = socket(result->ai_family, result->ai_socktype, result->ai_protocol);
iResult = connect(ServerSocket, result->ai_addr, (int)result->ai_addrlen);
freeaddrinfo(result);
```

Like we discussed above, our proxy will forward client packets to the
server and server packets to the client. However, not all client packets
will require a response from the server. For example, in Wesnoth, sending
a chat message does not require a response back. To ensure that our proxy
does not get stuck waiting for a server response, we need to set a timeout
on the server socket. This timeout will cause any
**recv** calls to fail after a set amount of time:

```c++
DWORD timeout = 1000;
setsockopt(ServerSocket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, (char*)&timeout, sizeof(timeout));
```

# Relaying Traffic

With both of our sockets created, we can now focus on relaying the traffic
between the client and server. Since Wesnoth does not send out server
responses unless a client sends a request, our proxy can be simplified to
the following events:

1. Wait for a request from the client.
1. Send that request to the server.
1. Wait for a response from the server.
1. If a response comes back, send to the client. Otherwise, start waiting
for the next client request.

After each event, our program will sleep for a short period to ensure that
the traffic between the client and server does not get desynchronized.
First, we will wait for a request from the client:

```c++
#define DEFAULT_BUFLEN 512

int iSendResult;
unsigned char recvbuf[DEFAULT_BUFLEN];
int recvbuflen = DEFAULT_BUFLEN;

do {
  iResult = recv(ClientSocket, (char*)recvbuf, recvbuflen, 0);
  Sleep(100);
```

If we retrieve a request, we pass this data to the server:

```c++
if (iResult > 0) {
  printf("Bytes received: %d\n", iResult);

  iSendResult = send(ServerSocket, (char*)recvbuf, iResult, 0);
  Sleep(100);
  printf("Bytes sent: %d\n", iSendResult);
```

Next, we wait for a response from the server. If a response actually comes
back, we forward this on to the client:

```c++
iResult = recv(ServerSocket, (char*)recvbuf, recvbuflen, 0);
Sleep(100);
if (iResult != SOCKET_ERROR) {
  iSendResult = send(ClientSocket, (char*)recvbuf, iResult, 0);
  Sleep(100);
}
```

Finally, we continue the loop while we have a result, or if we have a
timeout from the server:

```c++
} while (iResult > 0 || WSAGetLastError() == WSAETIMEDOUT);
```

At this point, our proxy will properly pass traffic from a client to a
server. We can verify this by running the proxy, connecting to it in
Wesnoth by setting the server to localhost:27015, and confirming that we
can connect to the actual server running on localhost:15000.

As a proof-of-concept, we can now add in logic to intercept and modify
traffic. First, we can import our **parse_data** and
**send_data** functions from our last lesson. Next, we will
modify our main loop to check any client requests and see if they contain
the chat message **\wave**. If so, we will send an additional
packet with a **Hello!** message:

```c++
if (iResult > 0) {
  printf("Bytes received: %d\n", iResult);
  if (parse_data(recvbuf, iResult)) {
    const unsigned char message[] = "[message]\nmessage=\"Hello!\"\nroom=\"lobby\"\nsender=\"ChatBot\"\n[/message]";
    send_data(message, sizeof(message), ServerSocket);
    Sleep(100);
  }
```

If you connect to the proxy now and send the chat message
**\wave**, you will see that an additional message appears on
the server, indicating that we successfully injected traffic into the
connection:
