Game hacking allows you to add functionality and change how games work.
Whether your goal is to add a new unit to an RTS game or create an aimbot
for a FPS game, Game Hacking Academy has lessons to learn along
with.

The lessons presented here contain a combination of general information on topics and walkthroughs of creating hacks, with pictures and explanations. The lessons build off of previous entries but will still make sense in whatever order you want to explore.
