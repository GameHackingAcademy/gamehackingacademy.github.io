# Target

Our target for this lesson will be Urban Terror 4.3.4.

# Identify

Our goal in this lesson is to create a chams hack, which is a type of hack
that colors all players a bright color. We can accomplish this by hooking
the gameâ€™s graphics library and modifying its code to make all player
models render with a bright color instead of a texture.

# Understand

When entities are rendered to the screen, they are just filled polygons.
To make these entities have visuals (such as eyes, camouflage, or hair),
textures have to be applied to the polygons. These textures are specially
formatted images, which wrap around the entity when applied to it. For
example, the oil barrel texture from Urban Terror looks like:

![Urban Terror Texture](/assets/images/5/4/urbanterror1.png)

When this is applied to the circular barrel model, it wraps around it.
This is how 2D textures are applied to 3D models.

To create a chams hack, we will modify this rendering flow. After the
polygons have been rendered, we will disable textures in OpenGL. When
textures are disabled, OpenGL will fall back to using the lighting (or
color) array specified by the game. If we disable that as well, OpenGL
will fall back to using whatever color was last specified by a call to
**glColor**. If we set our own color and then render the
entity, we can make the entity appear as a bright solid color, such as
red.

# Texture Function Pointers

To make our development easier, we will build off the OpenGL wallhack we
created in the previous lesson. For that, we created function pointers for
two functions related to depth testing:
**glDepthFunc** and **glDepthRange**. To disable
and enable textures, we will need to create function pointers to four
additional functions:

- **glEnable**
- **glDisable**
- **glEnableClientState**
- **glDisableClientState**

We plan to use **glEnable** and **glDisable** to
enable and disable GL_COLOR_MATERIAL. In addition, we will need to call
**glEnableClientState** and
**glDisableClientState** to enable and disable
**GL_COLOR_ARRAY** and
**GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY**. We will enable and disable all
these elements to ensure that OpenGL falls back to a mode where we can set
the color.

To set the color after we have done those steps, we will also need to
create a function pointer to **glColor**.
**glColor** has many forms that allow you to pass in
different type of parameters. Any of these functions will work, but for
our hack, we will use **glColor4f**, the version of
**glColor** that takes 4 floats (values that allow decimals):
one for red, green, blue, and alpha. The alpha float is responsible for
controlling the opacity of the color.

We can declare these function pointers right below the pointers for
**glDepthFunc** and **glDepthRange**:

```c++
void(__stdcall* glColor4f)(float, float, float, float) = NULL;
void(__stdcall* glEnable)(unsigned int) = NULL;
void(__stdcall* glDisable)(unsigned int) = NULL;
void(__stdcall* glEnableClientState)(unsigned int) = NULL;
void(__stdcall* glDisableClientState)(unsigned int) = NULL;
...
...
glColor4f = (void(__stdcall*)(float, float, float, float))GetProcAddress(openGLHandle, "glColor4f");
glEnable = (void(__stdcall*)(unsigned int))GetProcAddress(openGLHandle, "glEnable");
glDisable = (void(__stdcall*)(unsigned int))GetProcAddress(openGLHandle, "glDisable");
glEnableClientState = (void(__stdcall*)(unsigned int))GetProcAddress(openGLHandle, "glEnableClientState");
glDisableClientState = (void(__stdcall*)(unsigned int))GetProcAddress(openGLHandle, "glDisableClientState");
```

# glDrawElements Code Cave

In our code cave, we already have the logic built out to display models
through walls if they have a count greater than 500. We will expand on
this code to also color them. First, we will disable
**GL_COLOR_ARRAY** and
**GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY**. The game uses these client states
to let OpenGL know that the game wants to map textures and color arrays
(for lighting) to polygons. To apply a static color to a model, we need to
tell OpenGL that we are not using these features. Since these are
considered client states, we will use
**glDisableClientState** to disable them. We can get their
values from [gl.h:](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/api/GLES/1.0/gl.h)

```c++
if (count > 500) {
  ...
  (*glDisableClientState)(0x8078);
  (*glDisableClientState)(0x8076);
```

Next, we will enable **GL_COLOR_MATERIAL** and set our color
to red. **glColor4f** takes a value between 0 and 1 for all
values. If we want a red color, we will set the red value to 1 and the
alpha to 1. However, if we leave green and blue at 0, our ending red color
will be dark and muted. To make it vibrant, we will set these values to
0.6. Adding an f on the end of a number in C++ will cause the number to be
interpreted as a float:

```c++
(*glEnable)(0x0B57);
(*glColor4f)(1.0f, 0.6f, 0.6f, 1.0f);
```

Finally, just like with our wallhack, we will disable this coloring when
the model's count is less than 500. To do this, we will enable
**GL_COLOR_ARRAY** and
**GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY** and then disable
**GL_COLOR_MATERIAL**. Finally, we will make another call to
**glColor**, this time setting the color to a pure white.
This is not strictly necessary for Urban Terror, but for some games, this
will prevent the colors of effects from getting corrupted if they use the
previously set color:

```c++
(*glEnableClientState)(0x8078);
(*glEnableClientState)(0x8076);
(*glDisable)(0x0B57);
(*glColor4f)(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
```

With this done, you can inject the DLL into the game, and you will see all
the models appearing through walls with a bright red color:
