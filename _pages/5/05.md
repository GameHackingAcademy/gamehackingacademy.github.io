# Target

Our target for this lesson will be the game [Assault Cube 1.2.0.2,](https://assault.cubers.net/) since it
has an easy way to create bots and disable their movement. However, this
same technique will work on any FPS that displays a player's name when you
hover over a player.

# Identify

Our goal in this lesson is to create a triggerbot, a type of hack that
automatically fires whenever we look at another player.

# DLL Injection

While the following lessons can be done using the AppInit technique discussed
in previous lessons, using a DLL injector will vastly speed up development
time. From this point on, the rest of the lessons will assume that you are
using an injector. Creating a DLL injector is discussed in the [DLL Injector](/pages/7/01/) lesson. General-purpose DLL injectors can also be found online.

# Understand

To write a triggerbot, we need to calculate where our player is looking
and identify if we are looking at another player. Luckily for us, most
games already have this functionality in their code to display a nametag
when you hover over a player or change the crosshair to a different color.
Assault Cube displays a nametag, as seen in the bottom left-hand corner:

If we locate the code responsible for displaying this text, we can hook it
and write custom code to send a mouse press.

# Locating Code

The method for locating the responsible code will depend on how the game
reacts to hovering over a player. In general, games will react in two
different ways:

1. The crosshair will change, either in size or color.
1. The player's name we are looking at will be displayed somewhere on the
screen.

In games with the first reaction, we will have to search for one value
while not looking at a player and then filter for a different value while
looking at a player. After enough filtering, a value will remain that will
generally be 0 when not looking at a player, and 1 (or a value linked to
the player's location in the entity list) when looking at a player. You
can then set a breakpoint on this memory address and see what code writes
to it.

Other games, like Assault Cube, will display a string that represents the
player's name. In these cases, we can locate a player's name in memory and
then set a breakpoint on access on the name. When we hover over the
player, this breakpoint should pop at the code responsible for determining
if we are looking at a player.

First, make sure the nametags option is enabled in the HUD settings. Then,
start a new single-player deathmatch game with 8 bots. When the game
starts, hit the “~” key to open the console and run the command
*idlebots 1*. This [command](https://assault.cubers.net/docs/reference.html#identifier_idlebots) will disable bots from moving and shooting, making it easier to search for
the information we want. In games that do not have a way to disable bot
movement, you can use Cheat Engine's *Enable Speedhack* feature to
slow down the game and allow you to search easier:

![Cheat Engine's Speedhack Feature](/assets/images/5/5/cube2.png)

With the game started, find a particular bot and note its name down.
Search in Cheat Engine for this name, which should return about 10
results:

![Searching for Player Names](/assets/images/5/5/cube3.png)

Next, look away from the bot so that its nametag is no longer displayed.
For each address identified, use Cheat Engine's
*Find out what accesses this address* option, which will attach a
debugger to the process to determine what code is touching the memory:

![Cheat Engine Find Out What Accesses This Address Feature](/assets/images/5/5/cube4.png)

For each address, look at the bot again so that the nametag displays. We
are looking for an address which has a ton of accesses only when looking
at the bot. After going through several of the addresses, you should find
one that is always accessed only when looking at a bot:

![Code For Nametags](/assets/images/5/5/cube5.png)

With this code found, we can close Cheat Engine and start working on
reversing the responsible code.

# Locating Code Cave

Open up x64dbg and attach it to Assault Cube. In Assault Cube, make sure
that the nametag is still displaying. Navigate to the address we found in
Cheat Engine and place a breakpoint on the code. It should pop
immediately:

![Code For Nametags](/assets/images/5/5/cube6.png)

You will notice that we are inside a loop that is loading the player's
name into a buffer. We see that this loop is only entered if the
**je** at `0x0040ADA6` does not jump. The
condition for this jump is the **test edi, edi** instruction.
Testing a register against itself compares its value to 0. From this, we
can assume that the nametag is only displayed if **edi** is
not 0. We can confirm this behavior by setting a breakpoint on the
**test edi, edi** instruction. When looking at a player,
**edi** will have a value:

![Code For Nametags](/assets/images/5/5/cube7.png)

However, if we are not looking at a player, **edi** will hold
the value 0:

![Code For Nametags](/assets/images/5/5/cube8.png)

Looking at the **call** above, we can see that
**edi** gets its value from **eax**, which is
the return value from the **call**:

![Code For Nametags](/assets/images/5/5/cube9.png)

Since this **call** is 5 bytes, we will overwrite this
**call** with a code cave to our own code.

# Writing Code Cave

The logic for our code cave will be simple. First, we will execute the
call we hooked. Then, we will read the value of **eax** into
a variable. After that, we will read the value of the variable. If we are
looking at a player, we will use the [SendInput](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-sendinput) API to send a left mouse down event to the game. Otherwise, we will send a
left mouse up event to the game. We need to use this approach since
**SendInput** sets a key's state permanently. If we do not
send a left mouse up event, the mouse button will act as if it is held
down.

Like we discussed above, we will hook the **call** at
`0x0040AD9D`. We will do this in an identical manner to
previous lessons:

```c++
unsigned char* hook_location = (unsigned char*)0x0040AD9D;
...
VirtualProtect((void*)hook_location, 5, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &old_protect);
*hook_location = 0xE9;
*(DWORD*)(hook_location + 1) = (DWORD)&codecave - ((DWORD)hook_location + 5);
```

In our code cave, we will first start by calling the method that we
overwrote and then moving its return value (**eax**) into a
variable that we declare:

```c++
DWORD ori_call_address = 0x4607C0;
DWORD edi_value = 0;

__declspec(naked) void codecave() {
  __asm {
    call ori_call_address
    pushad
    mov edi_value, eax
  }
```

Next, we will check the value of our **edi_value** variable
to determine if we should send a left mouse down or mouse up event:

```c++
if (edi_value != 0) {
  //looking at player
}
else {
  //not looking at player
}
```

**SendInput** takes an array of input events, which allows
you to send multiple events. This can be useful if we want to do multiple
actions at once, such as firing and then reloading. In this lesson, we will
only send one input, which is the mouse down or mouse up event:

```c++
INPUT input = { 0 };
...
if (edi_value != 0) {
  input.type = INPUT_MOUSE;
  input.mi.dwFlags = MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN;
  SendInput(1, &input, sizeof(INPUT));
}
else {
  input.type = INPUT_MOUSE;
  input.mi.dwFlags = MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP;
  SendInput(1, &input, sizeof(INPUT));
}
```

Just like in previous lessons, we want to restore the registers and jump back
to the original code:

```c++
DWORD ori_jump_address = 0x0040ADA2;
...
_asm {
  popad
  jmp ori_jump_address
}
```

If you are using the DLL injector from the [DLL Injector](/pages/7/01/) lesson, we can make some small
modifications to use it for this target:

```c++
const char *dll_path = "C:\\Users\\IEUser\\source\\repos\\triggerbot\\Debug\\triggerbot.dll";
...
if (strcmp((const char*)pe32.szExeFile, (const char*)L"ac_client.exe") == 0) {
```

With those changes, we can inject the DLL into Assault Cube and hover over
a player. When we pass over a player, we will automatically fire.
