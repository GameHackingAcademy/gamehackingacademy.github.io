# Target

Our target for this lesson will be Assault Cube 1.2.0.2.

# Identify

Our goal in this lesson is to create a radar hack, a type of hack that
displays both enemies and friendly players on the radar.

# Understand

Many FPS games have a radar that will display an icon for each player on
top of a scaled-down version of the current map. When playing in a game
with teams, these radars will only show the players on the same team as
the active player. In the [Aimbot](/pages/5/06/) lesson, we
discovered the location of the list of players in the game. The code for
most games will iterate over this list when drawing a playerâ€™s icon on the
radar, in a similar manner to the following block:

```c++
void draw_radar() {
  for(int i = 0; i < max_players; i++) {
    if(player_list[i]->team == current_player->team) {
      //draw on radar
    }
  }        
}
```

If we locate this code, we can change the if conditional to always draw
the player on the radar regardless of the team. To locate the code, we
will first need to identify the **team** member in our player
structure. Then, we can set a breakpoint on access to identify where this
member is accessed in code.

# Locate Player's Team

We can use two approaches to locate the player's team in the player
structure:

1. Use Cheat Engine and search for an *Unknown initial value*. Then,
alternate between teams and search for *Changed value*.
1. Use x64dbg and locate the player's structure in a dump. Then, alternate
between teams and search for a member that changes.

We have covered both of these approaches in past lessons. Using the
techniques discussed previously, you should be able to identify a member
that alternates between 0 and 1 depending on your team. This member is
relatively close to the member we identified previously that held whether
the player was alive or not.

# Locate Radar Function

We know that the radar function must access the player's team. Therefore,
we can place a breakpoint on access on the team member we just identified.
Immediately, the breakpoint should pop. However, if you continue execution
several times, you should see that the breakpoint pops in completely
different sections of code. This is most likely because several sections
of code access this member. Our next step is identifying the section of
code responsible for drawing the radar.

We can assume a few things about the code we are looking for, based on the
pseudo code we described above:

- It will have a **cmp** (or **test**)
instruction followed by a conditional jump (**je**,
**jne**, **jg**, etc.).
- It will either call a function or have a fair amount of code, due to the
many operations involved.
- It will most likely make use of the floating point operations
(**fld**, **fstp**) to position the icon on
the radar.

We can use these features to help figure out which location we care about
in the code.

Because we are interrupting program execution, the breakpoints will not
pop in a consistent manner. In this lesson, we will examine each piece of
code in the order they were encountered when writing the lesson. In your
environment, the order of pops will most likely be different.

The first pop occurs at the following code:

![Radar Hack](/assets/images/5/8/radar2.png)

This initially looks like it checks off several of the conditions we care
about. However, if we **nop** the
**jne** instruction at `0x415322`, we notice that
there is no change in the game. If you explore the
**call** at `0x415326`, you should see the
following code:

![Radar Hack](/assets/images/5/8/radar3.png)

From this string constant, we can assume that this code has something to
do with drawing the voice chat (or communication) symbols on the radar.
Now we will continue on to the next location:

![Radar Hack](/assets/images/5/8/radar4.png)

For our immediate reversing purpose, testing a register against itself is
the same as comparing the register to 0. Here, we see that the code
executes a branch if the player's team is set to 0, or the CLA team. The
radar drawing operation should execute according to the value stored in
the player's structure, not a static value. Now we can move on to the next
location:

![Radar Hack](/assets/images/5/8/radar5.png)

Examining this code, we see that it is doing an operation similar to the
previous code. After loading in the value of the player's team to
**ecx**, the code compares this value to 1, or the RSVF team
with the **test cl, 1** instruction. The same logic applies
here as it does in the paragraph above, so let's examine the next
location:

![Radar Hack](/assets/images/5/8/radar6.png)

Like our first location, this looks like a promising candidate. The
**cmp** instruction at the top compares our current player's
team against **eax**, which appears to be loading the same
team offset from another data structure, potentially another player. We
also see several floating point operations that may be responsible for
placing the icon on the radar. Let's see what happens if we
**nop** out the **jne** instruction:

![Radar Hack](/assets/images/5/8/radar7.png)

If you go back into Assault Cube, you should notice that you can now see
every player on the radar, including the ones that are not on your team.
We have found our responsible radar code.

# Changing the Code

Since this hack only requires us to write bytes to a memory address, we
can use the same technique as discussed in the [No Recoil](/pages/5/07/) lesson:

```c++
#include <Windows.h>

unsigned char new_bytes[5] = { 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90 };

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved) {
  DWORD old_protect;
  unsigned char* hook_location = (unsigned char*)0x409FB3;

  if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {
    VirtualProtect((void*)hook_location, 5, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &old_protect);
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(new_bytes); i++) {
      *(hook_location + i) = new_bytes[i];
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```
