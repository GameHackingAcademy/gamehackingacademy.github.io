# Target

Our target for this lesson will be Assault Cube 1.2.0.2.

# Identify

Our goal in this lesson is to create an aimbot, a type of hack that
automatically aims at other players.

# Understand

The core fundamentals of an aimbot rely on trigonometry. Take the
following scene from our target game, Assault Cube:

![Assault Cube Gameplay](/assets/images/5/6/cube1.png)

Focusing on just our in-game player and the enemy, this scene can be
mapped onto a 3D graph that looks like:

![3D Representation](/assets/images/5/6/cube2.png)

To simplify, we can convert this into a 2D graph by fixing our perspective
and eliminating one of the axes. By choosing a top-down perspective, we
can eliminate the Z axis. The resulting graph would look like:

![2D Representation](/assets/images/5/6/cube3.png)

Every first-person or third-person shooter allows the player to look left
and right to aim. For example, in our first screenshot, our player is
looking straight ahead. On our 2D graph, this would look like:

![3D Representation](/assets/images/5/6/cube4.png)

If we are looking at an enemy, like so:

![3D Representation](/assets/images/5/6/cube5.png)

Then our graph would change to look like:

![3D Representation](/assets/images/5/6/cube6.png)

Games represent this left and right value as an angle. They can represent
this angle in multiple ways, such as a vector, a radian, or a degree.
However, for our current example, we will assume the view angle is
represented in degrees. To create an aimbot, we need to find a way to
calculate this angle for an enemy. We can do this by first creating a
right triangle using our player's position and the enemy's position:

![3D Representation](/assets/images/5/6/cube7.png)

If we knew the value of θ, we could use the tangent operation to determine
the ratio between the opposite (7 above) and adjacent (5 above) sides. In
our case, we have the opposite and adjacent sides and want to determine θ.
To do this, we can calculate the inverse tangent or arctangent. The
arctangent will then represent the angle we need to set our player's aim
to aim at an enemy.

However, this will only correctly aim to the left and right. To aim up and
down, we will need to do a similar operation for the Y and Z axes.

Before we can do any of this, though, we will need to locate where the
game stores enemies. Then, we will need to locate where the game stores
our player. Finally, we will need to reverse the player structure to
locate the X, Y, and Z members in the structure, as well as the view angle
members.

# Locating Enemies

To locate enemies in the game, first create a game with 8 bots and set
them to idle. Typically, games will store enemies in a list and hold a
static location to this list. In the previous lesson, we found the game code
responsible for displaying a player's name when you hovered over that
player. To do this, the game must have code inside that function that
iterates over the enemies in the game and retrieves their names. This was
the code we located in the last lesson:

![Code For Finding Current Player Looked at](/assets/images/5/6/cube8.png)

When reversing this code, we determined that the **call** to
`0x4607c0` at `0x40ad9d` was responsible for loading
the current player looked at into **eax**. If we step into
this **call**, we can see that a **call** at the
end is responsible for getting this value:

![Code For Finding Current Player Looked at](/assets/images/5/6/cube9.png)

Stepping into this **call**, we can see that it is rather
long with many loops and conditionals. As we step through the code, you
will notice the following line:

![Code For Finding Current Player Looked at](/assets/images/5/6/cube10.png)

From this, we can determine two things. The first is that
**[0x50f500]** will hold the current number of players in the
game. We will need this value later when we are iterating through all the
players to aim at them. The second is that **eax** is being
compared to this value, with a **jmp** below that executes if
**eax** is less than this value. This means that we are most
likely in code responsible for looping through all the active players. A
few lines below, you will notice the following code:

![Code For Finding Current Player Looked at](/assets/images/5/6/cube11.png)

This code is loading a static memory address into **ecx** and
then retrieving a new address based on that address's value combined with
an offset from **eax**. This new value is then loaded into
**esi**. The first time this loop occurs, the value of
**esi** is 0:

![Code For Finding Current Player Looked at](/assets/images/5/6/cube12.png)

However, if we continue and execute the loop again,
**esi** holds a different value:

![Code For Finding Current Player Looked at](/assets/images/5/6/cube13.png)

If we examine **esi**'s value in the dump, we can see that it
is always near an address that holds a player's name:

![Code For Finding Current Player Looked at](/assets/images/5/6/cube14.png)

This is most likely the enemy player's structure in memory, as one of the
values that will be held in this structure is the player's name. For now,
we have identified that the list of enemies is held at
**[0x50f4f8]**, with each enemy being at
**[[0x50f4f8] + 4,8,C...]**. Once we find our player's
structure, we will reverse exactly how the player structure is laid out in
memory.

# Locating Our Player

Next, we need to locate where our own player is stored in memory. Since we
can never look at ourselves, we need to find our player in a different
manner. Many games have a way to print your current position and view
angle to the screen. In Assault Cube, this can be done with
*dbgpos 1*. When turned on with *showstats 1*, the output looks
like:

![dbgpos](/assets/images/5/6/cube15.png)

If your target does not have this feature, you will instead have to search
for unknown values and then filter while carefully moving your mouse or
player in a single direction. In Assault Cube, it looks like our view
angle is represented by *yaw* (left and right) and *pitch* (up
and down), with both values in degrees. We will need to keep this model in
mind for later. For now, we know that our player structure will have to
contain these values. In Cheat Engine, we can search for our yaw in memory
and then see what accesses the address:

![Yaw address](/assets/images/5/6/cube16.png)

The **fstp** instruction copies a floating point number into
the address specified. In this case, that address is based on
**ecx**. If we examine this instruction in x64dbg and then
view several lines above, we can find where **ecx** is being
set:

![Yaw address](/assets/images/5/6/cube17.png)

If we examine the memory pointed to by **[0x509b74]**, we see
a structure identical to what we observed with enemies, with our player's
name appearing near this address:

![Player address](/assets/images/5/6/cube18.png)

This most likely represents our player's structure. Since we have more
control over the values in this structure, we can begin reversing it.

# Reversing Player Structure

We know that the game must store data about each player in memory. This
data will generally be in a continuous section of memory. In C or C++,
this would be represented as a structure or a class. For example, a game
might define the **Player** structure like:

```c++
struct Player {
  float x;
  float y;
  float z;
  float yaw;
  float pitch;
  char model_texture_path[128];
  char name[128];
  bool alive;
}
```

When viewed in x64dbg, this structure will appear as a long section of
memory since data has no concept of its type. To identify this data, we
will need to reverse the structure. x64dbg allows you to modify the data
representation in the dump. The default view is hex with ASCII
representation. We will start by trying to find the values for our
position, which is represented by three float values. We can right-click
and choose *Float* to have the dump data displayed in this format:

![Player address](/assets/images/5/6/cube19.png)

Upon doing so, several values should jump out immediately, which represent
our X, Y, and Z:

![Player address](/assets/images/5/6/cube20.png)

Similarly, our yaw and pitch are easily observable as well:

![Player address](/assets/images/5/6/cube21.png)

# Changing our View Angle

At this point, we have all the offsets we need to start creating our
aimbot. The first step is making a DLL that will continuously spin our
player in a circle. We want to start with this to ensure that we have
correctly located our player and reversed the player structure correctly.
Like we have done previously, we will start by creating a thread that will
run inside the game's process:

```c++
#include <Windows.h>

void injected_thread() {
  while (true) {
    //aimbot code
    Sleep(1);
  }
}

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved) {
  if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {
    CreateThread(NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)injected_thread, NULL, 0, NULL);
  }

  return true;
}
```

We have covered this code several times in previous lessons. Next, we need to
define our **Player** structure above our
**injected_thread** function:

```c++
struct Player {

}
```

From our work before, we know that our X, Y, and Z members are at the
**base+4**, **base+8**, and
**base+C**, respectively. We don't know what the first 4
bytes represent, but we luckily don't need to. Instead, we can create a
placeholder member that is an array of characters. We choose characters
since they are 1 byte long. We can then create float members for our X, Y,
and Z values:

```c++
struct Player {
  char unknown1[4];
  float x;
  float y;
  float z;
}
```

Next, we need to add in our **yaw** and
**pitch** members. If we look at the memory, we see that
**Z** ends at `0xc3a230` and
**yaw** begins at `0xc3a260`. Like the placeholder
above, we will use a **char** member to add
`0x30` bytes of padding before adding our
**yaw** and **pitch**:

```c++
struct Player {
  char unknown1[4];
  float x;
  float y;
  float z;
  char unknown2[0x30];
  float yaw;
  float pitch;
}
```

We will then create a pointer from this structure that we will use to map
the game's memory into later:

```c++
Player *player = NULL;
```

With our structure created, we can now map the game's memory of the player
to our structure. First, we will create a pointer to
`0x509b74` in our **while** loop, since this
represents the base address of our player:

```c++
DWORD *player_offset = (DWORD*)(0x509B74);
```

Next, we will dereference this pointer to get the value of the player's
base address. We will then map the dereferenced address to our
**Player** structure pointer. This will store the values we
observed in the dump into this structure so that we can reference them in
our code.

```c++
player = (Player*)(*player_offset);
```

Finally, we will increase the **yaw** member in a loop to
cause our player to spin in a circle:

```c++
player->yaw++;
```

From here, we can build and inject this DLL. Our player will now spin
around in a circle, showing that we have correctly reversed the player
structure.

# Aiming Left and Right

With all of this in place, we can create the first version of our aimbot.
This version will aim left and right at a single opponent. When testing
this out, make sure to create a two-player game, with you and a single
bot. This will let you nail down the math.

First, we will use the same approach as before to map the first enemy into
a **Player** structure. When reversing the code, we
identified that the first enemy was at **+4**:

```c++
DWORD* enemy_list = (DWORD*)(0x50F4F8);
DWORD* enemy_offset = (DWORD*)(*enemy_list + 4);
Player* enemy = (Player*)(*enemy_offset);
```

One issue with our previous code was that we would crash if we were not in
a game. That’s because we were accessing memory that wasn't valid. To
prevent this, we will check to make sure both of our pointers are valid
before continuing:

```c++
if (player != NULL && enemy != NULL) {
```

At the beginning of this lesson, we had the following graph:

![3D Representation](/assets/images/5/6/cube7.png)

In this graph, we knew the opposite and adjacent distances based on the
enemy's position. However, as we have seen when reversing, our position is
never (0, 0). Instead, the graph would look more like:

![3D Representation](/assets/images/5/6/cube22.png)

If we attempt to use the enemy's position, our calculations will be
incorrect. Instead, we need to determine these values by subtracting the
player's position from the enemy's position. This will give us values that
will act as if the player is always at (0, 0), or the absolute position
(**abspos**) between our player and the enemy:

```c++
float abspos_x = enemy->x - player->x;
float abspos_y = enemy->y - player->y;
```

Next, we can calculate the arctangent using the
**atan2f** function. We use this function as opposed to
**atanf**, as it takes care of the case in which
**abspos_y** is less than 0. Since the inverse tangent is an
unsigned operation (i.e., it doesn't have a concept of positive or
negative), our aimbot would aim in the opposite direction if the enemy was
directly behind us. We could manually check for this by checking
**abspos_y**, but **atan2f** takes care of this
calculation for us:

```c++
#include <math.h>

...
float azimuth_xy = atan2f(abspos_y, abspos_x);
```

The **atan2f** function produces a radian value. When
reversing, we saw that the game represents our yaw as a degree value. To
convert the radian to a degree value, we can multiply the radian by
**(180 / π)**:

```c++
#define M_PI 3.14159265358979323846

...            
float yaw = (float)(azimuth_xy * (180.0 / M_PI));
```

Finally, we can set our player's **yaw** to this value:

```c++
player->yaw = yaw;
```

If you inject this code into the game, you will notice that you aim close
to the player, but always a consistent amount of pixels to the left or
right, depending on where you are standing. This is because in our
graphing model, we assumed that 0° was facing straight ahead. However, if
you join a game without the hack, you will notice your player's starting
yaw is 90°. To compensate for this, we can simply add
**90** to our calculated yaw:

```c++
player->yaw = yaw + 90;
```

With this change, we can run around the map and constantly stay locked on
a player. However, if we jump up and down or go up an incline, we will be
aiming above or below the enemy. Our next step is to set our pitch (or up
and down) value correctly.

# Aiming Up and Down

When we first approached this problem, we quickly set our perspective as
top-down to eliminate the Z axis. To calculate our up and down angle, we
will now fix our perspective as right-left (i.e., on the right of the
player, looking directly at the player's right side). The most important
thing to note in our new graph below is the different axis values:

![3D Representation](/assets/images/5/6/cube23.png)

We can use a similar approach to the left and right angle to calculate the
up and down angle. First, we will get the absolute distance:

```c++
float abspos_z = enemy->z - player->z;
```

Then, like before, we will calculate the inverse tangent. Unlike the yaw,
our initial pitch starts at 0, so we don't need to add any value to it:

```c++
float azimuth_z = atan2f(abspos_z, abspos_y);
player->pitch = (float)(azimuth_z * (180.0 / M_PI));
```

If you inject this code, it will appear to initially work. However, when
you get within arm's distance of an enemy, your player will suddenly look
straight up or straight down. This is due to the game having very limited
Z values. For example, most maps in the game have Z values between 0 and 6. When the value of Y gets too small, the resulting equation ends up
being skewed. Imagine the case where the difference in Z values was 3 but
the Y value difference was 1, or arctan(3 / 1). This resolves to 75°,
which is effectively straight up in the air when it comes to pitch.

To account for this behavior, we will look at the value of Y and ensure
that it is reasonably large. If it’s not, we will use X. This is not
perfect, but it will help alleviate some of the issues. We will also
ensure that the value is positive, regardless:

```c++
if (abspos_y < 0) {
  abspos_y *= -1;
}
if (abspos_y < 5) {
  if (abspos_x < 0) {
    abspos_x *= -1;
  }
  abspos_y = abspos_x;
}
```

Now you will notice that you can run up directly to the enemy and your aim
will not jump in the air. Our aimbot is now working for a single enemy.

# Multiple Enemies

With this foundation down, we can modify our aimbot to work with multiple
enemies. To do this, we will change the code to iterate through the enemy
list, pick an enemy to aim at, and set our yaw and pitch to aim at them.
To pick the enemy, we will choose to always select the enemy closest to
us. This will not always be the best case. For example, if one enemy is
down a hall and one enemy is behind a wall next to us, our aimbot will
always pick the enemy behind the wall. However, for the purpose of this
lab, this method is the easiest to implement.

To find the enemy closest to us, we will calculate the Euclidean distance
between our player and the enemy. The lower the value, the closer the
enemy is to us:

```c++
float euclidean_distance(float x, float y) {
  return sqrtf((x * x) + (y * y));
}
```

Since we need to iterate over a list of enemies, we will create a variable
to hold the closest enemy distance, as well as their associated yaw and
pitch values:

```c++
while (true) {
  DWORD* player_offset = (DWORD*)(0x509B74);
  player = (Player*)(*player_offset);
  ...
  float closest_player = -1.0f;
  float closest_yaw = 0.0f;
  float closest_pitch = 0.0f;
```

At the beginning of this lesson, we determined the address that held the
current number of players in the game. We can finally use that value now:

```c++
int* current_players = (int*)(0x50F500);
```

We can now iterate over all the enemies in the game. Unlike before, where
we always added 4, we will now add the current loop index multiplied by 4,
identically to how the game did it:

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < *current_players; i++) {
  DWORD* enemy_list = (DWORD*)(0x50F4F8);
  DWORD* enemy_offset = (DWORD*)(*enemy_list + (i*4));
  Player* enemy = (Player*)(*enemy_offset);
```

We can then calculate the absolute positions like we did before. However,
before calculating the yaw or pitch, we will calculate the distance from
our player to the enemy and ensure that they are the closest enemy. If
they are, we will then set the **closest_player** value to
their distance for future checks:

```c++
float temp_distance = euclidean_distance(abspos_x, abspos_y);
if (closest_player == -1.0f || temp_distance < closest_player) {
  closest_player = temp_distance;
```

Next, instead of directly setting the player's yaw and pitch, we will
store these in our variables. Once we have iterated over all the enemies,
we will set the player's yaw and pitch. This ensures that we aren't
constantly flickering through multiple enemies:

```c++
closest_yaw = yaw + 90;
...

closest_pitch = (float)(azimuth_z * (180.0 / M_PI));
...

player->yaw = closest_yaw;
player->pitch = closest_pitch;

Sleep(1);
```

We now have a working aimbot that will iterate through multiple enemies
and aim at the closest one correctly in the X and Y axis.

Finally, we can add a check to see if the enemy is alive, to ensure that
we instantly switch from a target when we shoot them. This value can be
found by observing the player structure for values that change when you
are alive or dead. After killing yourself several times, you will notice
that one value is set to 0 when you are alive and 1 when you are dead:

![3D Representation](/assets/images/5/6/cube24.png)

We can add this to our player structure, ensuring that we correctly offset
it:

```c++
  float yaw;
  float pitch;
  char unknown3[0x2f0];
  int dead;
};
```

We can then check this value in our initial check to ensure that the
player and enemy are valid:

```c++
if (player != NULL && enemy != NULL && !enemy->dead) {
```
The final result:
